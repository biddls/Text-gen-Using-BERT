 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily way refuel where I cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host tentis asano and today's 27th of may 2022 Alright everyone. Let's get into it So I had crazy 24 hours in the crypto ecosystem a lot of FUD around ethereum A lot of FUD that I'm probably gonna have to spend a bit of time debunking here And I made a kind of like list Kind of here that I'm gonna go through but basically I put out a tweet today where I say, you know Holy shit The amount of FUD being thrown in ethereum today is just too much The worst part is that the FUD is so misinformed that I feel like I'm back in 2018 I encourage all of you not to just read random tweets and take them as fact and then I listed out some of the FUD Here people brought more FUD to my attention that I didn't that I kind of like I didn't remember Basically the beacon chain reorg FUD from people who don't understand it now. I've spoke about this yesterday So I'm not gonna rehash this here But there was a good tweet thread here from Martin Martin Koppelman the person who put the out the original tweet thread I highly highly recommend going and giving this a read Because it basically describes exactly what happened and why it is unlucky to happen in the future and what you know What fixes are in place and things like that? But the TLDR just for those who didn't maybe didn't kind of like understand my explanation yesterday basically What happened was that? one set of clients had a one kind of like fork choice rule that they were kind of adhering to and what if the fork choice rule means is basically When kind of like validators are building kind of like blocks and building on a chain there the fork choice will kind of like dictates Kind of what happens and kind of like what chain to build on what chain kind of like that where the head is So if you don't understand kind of like that terminology, this is just kind of like fundamental blockchain stuff but essentially what happened is like half of them had the kind of like proposal boost feature and half of them didn't which meant that I mean there wasn't a kind of like a failure of consensus But it meant that one of them was kind of like working far So one set of validators working faster than the others and then there was a kind of like that real that happened But I highly recommend giving Martin's thread a read here as it explains it much better than I can and it was a really really great thread So that that kind of like five is pretty much debunked at this point, but I still saw people spreading it It's just really silly father And then the second one was some people are saying that the beacon chain doesn't have finality Which I was like what the fuck is it does it has finality every 12 minutes every two epic so an epic is six minutes And then every two epics we have economic finality which means two-thirds of the staked eighth basically puts its weight behind Everything up up until that point not being able to be kind of like Kind of like real basically all kind of like Changed and if it does attempt to be changed well Then that two-thirds of eight would kind of like get slashed we have those in protocol mechanisms I think there were some people who said well what we really meant was You know instead of finality we meant fast finality which is what something like ten to meet has And if you're is working towards faster finality But the thing is is the reason why we didn't do fast finality is because with fast finality you're limited to the amount of valid As you can have on the network and a theorem obviously wanted to optimize for as many validators as possible And that's why they went from kind of like that 12-minute finality instead of fast finality Which is usually much quicker than that, but there are upgrades coming that would That cool what they would kind of like put that into a theorem will make finality faster But a theorem the beacon chain does have finality right it's just not the kind of like fast finality that you may see some other Chains that have kind of like made that other trade-off of having less validators But kind of like faster finality there and then third here Which is about Robstin so people are saying that because some miners threw more hash at Robstin it means the merge on main net is Super risky, so what happened with Robstin basically there's a few threads here that I want to kind of kind of highlight Not not this one Where's this one what this one here from Preston Van Loon who kind of like put a screenshot out showing that Robstin's hash rate actually Spiked now as you guys know Robstin is going through the merge transition on June 8th And it had a TTD value kind of like given to it which basically meant like once it reaches this kind of like difficulty You'll do the merge now some miners basically trolled Robstin through their hash rate behind it and sped up TTD Which meant TDD actually happened yesterday? I think or today like earlier today And you know that's just being that's just being kind of like Reconfigured so it'll happen later It happened at the kind of like the original time But essentially it was just a troll attack from I mean I don't know call it an attack It's just like a troll from miners, and this can't happen on main net so it doesn't even matter This is literally a waste of time for for core devs now They have to kind of like deal with this because this is impossible to happen on main net well I mean not impossible But extremely unlikely because to do this on main net you would need to buy like a shit ton of miners right and point a shit ton of hash at a theorem which is infeasible and Basically there's a couple of threads about the Robstin issue one here from Tamar's Which has a detailed description of the Robstin TTD issue that you can go and check out? But also kind of one here from Doug who says why the Robstin TTD attack is not feasible for the merge on a theorem main net Explains it. I'm just highlighting these threads because I want you guys to kind of kind of give those kind of a read there, and then there's one here from Lawrence who kind of like Gave more context out what happened with Robstin here, but yeah, essentially what happened was that I guess the TLDR of TLDR Is that some miners put hash behind Robstin they sped up the kind of like timeline to getting to TTD? TTD was reached and then kind of like the core devs are like well We obviously don't want it to reach now because the Robstin beacon chain isn't even live right like the Robstin beacon chain doesn't go Laughter the 30th of May, so there's no merge going to happen But as I said it's just been kind of like a waste of time for core devs because they have to deal with this And as I said it's more of a troll than an attack because it doesn't really attack anything This is not a feasible thing to do on main net so it's not going to affect the main net merge at all And it's just like a waste of core devs time to kind of like deal with this now So that was that kind of like FUD there, then there was some some more FUD around Where is it? I'm going through my tabs here I mean someone put this out as a joke saying that there was a massive eight-year vesting unlock from the Eth ICO that started yesterday, and I was like what like and then they said oh, I'm just joking But like the thing is a lot of people believed this it wasn't just a joke and there was someone on a podcast I think Scott Malka With you kind of like a bunch of people talking about this as if it was fact And I was like what the fuck is going on like so for the F bombs lately guys But like my mind like right now is just duh anyway What happened was this person put out the tweet and then and someone ran with it And then people kind of like believed it guys the Ethereum ICO had no vesting there are no tokens unlocking Everyone that got their eith from the ICO either is still holding it or has sold like there's no vet There's no more eith to unlock especially not after eight years like what like I just don't know what what's going on Like why do people believe this to begin with but anyway? This is totally false not true at all just wanted to kind of like cover that as another bit of um Of FUD that I've seen and I'm sure there's other bits and pieces here that I've kind of like That I've kind of like missed or kind of can't think of right now But that was it for the last 24 hours in in FUD land guys like I am I'm just like so puzzled like I have To be honest with you like as I said I haven't seen this amount of just like stupid FUD Since the 2018 bottom, and I don't know if the markets are gonna bottom here I'm actually gonna talk about the markets in a sec, but like I don't know if the markets are gonna bottom here I don't know if it's gonna go lower than what it is now I don't know any of that sort of stuff right you guys know I'm a long-term investor I don't really care about the short-term stuff, but in saying that there is a saying narrative is dictated by Kind of like price Where were all these people FUD in ETH when it was at a higher price like when was we used with 3k plus? Where was all this FUD it didn't exist right and now that ETH is like I guess 1800 whatever it is right now people are now saying things like oh the merge is like super risky We have to risk off ETH because it's like super technically risky look at the beacon chain look at the reorg that happened there Oh, they don't know what they're doing blah blah You know all this kind of like just FUD becoming I know because the price went down right so I put out a tweet right Where I basically said until you realize that narrative follows price and not the other way around You're not going to make it pay attention to how many people are now coming out of the woodwork To be bearish on ETH based on some narratives just because it went down in price So if someone is literally just changing their opinion on some on an asset because it goes up or down in price That someone is not worth listening to in my eyes. Yes, you can have a thesis that doesn't play out And then you can kind of like admit okay. Well. I had this thesis. I was bullish on it It hasn't played out you know But you're not changing your thesis just because the price went down you're changing it because the fundamentals changed right There's a very very different thing there, so so that's that there But there was this tweet here from Joseph Lubin that I thought of today, and this is one of the most legendary tweets I love this one he put this out on December 22nd 2018 this was six days after ETH bottomed at $80 in 2018 He said I'm calling the crypto bottom of 2018 this bottom is marked by an epic amount of fear uncertainty and doubt From our friends in the fourth and crypto fifth estates now He has a little thread here, but that's like kind of a gist of it there So he called the bottom pretty pretty spot on here But pay attention to that this bottom is marked by an epic amount of fear uncertainty and doubt That's what I felt at the last 48 hours an epic amount of fear uncertainty and doubt now what I really want to highlight for You guys is the replies here This is just chef's kiss the replies are very similar to what? Are we seeing today this person here with all due respect the bottom isn't in however I am holding a beta C and Ethan wouldn't sell Any of it because they're both going to make new all-time highs in next in the next five years right so they obviously got The um the second part right there, but like the bottom isn't in right like so confidently with all due respect The bottom isn't in right and then there's a bunch of these kind of like replies Yeah, there's there's a I'm just kind of like scrolling through them here I should have saved them before but basically you know I'll call the bottom when when you particular Kick a picture like hell. No yeah, this isn't this isn't the kind of like the bottom the bottom Where else is there's a bunch more here? Cryptos and have a bottom. I'm calling the bottom. You know oblivious blah blah Man, there's this one tweet that I really wanted to hire for you guys I should have kind of like brought it up before before I kind of um oh yeah from tadpole He said crypto have net has never experienced a true bear market in the overall economy I don't think we can call bottom until we see a bottom in the stock market We're in uncharted waters for crypto you could take this tweet Which was put out December 22nd 2018 and literally reposted today? May 27th 2022 and it would sound exactly the same and it would mean exactly the same as it meant back then There are the same people saying this today. I'm not saying people there There are the sim there are similar things being said today I mean a crypto can't bottom because the the overall economy is in the shits like crypto has to gun I'm sorry the stock market has the bottom first all these sorts of stuff right ah Like it's just crazy I really like going back and learning from history because it never changed like humans don't change right like where I mean Tim Shaughnessy I think the team Sean Tom Sean is someone our company's name right now on Bankless I was into a podcast recently on there But he said that we all run human os and human always doesn't get an upgrade for thousands tens of thousands of years Because human evolution takes much longer So think about financial markets over the last 100 years humans haven't changed at all so you can go back a hundred years and humans will have been the same back then as they are today in their reactions to Markets and just going back and learning from that history can actually help you and help you stay grounded So I just wanted to highlight these kind of like replies you can keep you can keep going It's like I think apathy will mark the bottom commodities can grind sideways for years Those who know it best love at least because they have been disappointed most many projects don't need a token as part of their architecture Again, take this tweet post it today It's the same thing right like eight is a dead coin It is gonna dump 250 USD in a week right look guys. I'm as I said I'm not saying that right now is the bottom like all that 1700 is the bottom I don't know where the bottom is But just reading the replies to this tweet when a third already bottom to mind you it had been six days since 880 bucks I think Joe put this out when it was about 95 $100 so he had already bottoms But people didn't believe it because people were like really bearish It works both ways on the way up guys like on the way up people were calling for a 20k 8th, right? I know I was saying could possibly go there. I you know who knows right? It's a bull market But the thing is like okay That's a bull market now We're in a bear market and the people calling for things like triple digit 8 doesn't that sound the same as someone calling for 20k 8 in terms of kind of like the greediness so bears get greedy too, right? They might they may have like shorts open that they don't want to close yet Or they may be sitting in cash and they want to buy in at the cheapest possible price They're going to say whatever and at the end of the day No one has a crystal ball. No one has any idea what the price is going to do in the short medium Even the long term you make your bets you place your bets There's never a hundred percent certainty in anything in investing ever and that's the cardinal sin of investing is thinking that It's a sure thing right as bullish as I am on eighth There is no way in hell that I would ever say that our eighth is a hundred percent Guaranteed to do this or 100% guaranteed to do that because I can't guarantee that I can't tell the future if I could it'd be A lot easier to invest but alas I'm not what's that character from back to the future right that they're kind of like had the sports Almanac, I'm not him can't do that So when you're looking at the markets when you're looking at the public commentary on Twitter When you're looking at kind of like Fudd when you're looking at people kind of like calling for like ridiculous prices either way I'm not just talking about down. I'm talking about up as well Just remember that no one knows Everyone's giving an opinion. There's not a fact so just do not listen to them as if they're saying something That's a fact you have to position yourself for what suits you best you buy when you want to buy Oh, and you feel like is the time to buy maybe you're using a guy Maybe there's someone you follow that has like a really great model for buying bottoms and selling tops you can follow that maybe it works Maybe it doesn't there's no guarantee that it's gonna work, but you're free to do what you want but what I'm saying in general is that you need to just like Understand that now already follows price People say shit about price all the time everyone talks out of their ass basically about price. No one knows where it's gonna go and And you know as long as you kind of like come to terms with that I think you'll do well over over kind of like the longer terms there But I think that might be it for another daily way rants here, but yeah I just all these kind of like tweets and everything will be linked in the YouTube description you can go check out for yourself But I mean the the father around Robson was super hilarious to me. It's like guys It's a freaking test net like like why are you fighting and like it has nothing to do with main net either It's not like this is gonna impact the main net merge and all that sorts of stuff and then the continued beacon chain Fart is like oh my god. You know seven block real is catastrophic I mean to be fair a seven block real if It was post merge and there was a lot of activity in the blocks and things like that Would have probably hurt some users because of the MEV implications but The thing is people acting like it's the end of a theorem They're acting like it's a fundamental issue with a theorem proof of stake when it isn't a theorem proof of stake works fine If a hundred percent of the clients were running the proposal Bruce this would never have happened and now I'm sure a lot of more Clients have updated as I said they're gonna be forced to update anyway as part of a hard fork that's coming for the merge related fork for the beacon chain and Even Martin said in his thread that he doesn't expect there to be real like this on on post merge at all and I don't expect that either like it's just it's just funny when you kind of like look at this sort Of stuff because it's just it's so it's not complex like there are there are kind of like threads out there explaining it like you're five I'm trying to explain it to you guys as best as I can You know there are smart people telling you that guys like this is not The issue that everyone is making it out to be right But as I said worst case scenario is if something like this happened post merge There would be MEV consequences here and users would probably lose money in that sense But I mean it just depends right depends what happened in those seven blocks obviously so yeah anyway I'm gonna move on from that now I've got some other things to get through but I'll link all of these tweets in the YouTube description for you to check out Alright, so John here from Adelphi digital put out what I really do believe is that the definitive deep dive on a theorem Is a roadmap so it's called the hitchhiker's guide to a theorem. It is long and dense guys Like this is not light weekend reading this is sitting down Removing all distractions and reading it and taking it all in because you can see I'll scroll through it here It's very very long and very dense and lots of technical jargon And this is basically everything you need to know about a theorem's roadmap all in one piece and there's chapters You can go through it if you don't want to read about certain things But this is deep so if you're interested in being as up-to-date on the ethereum Road map as possible from a technical level as well, then this is the guide to read I just think this is absolutely awesome like the fact that someone was has put this together is great because I'm gonna link this to Everyone from now on and be like hey this might be a bit technical But if you really care about what's coming for a theorem a theorem is roadmap in general This is what you should be reading, and I've actually already yet like I mean I haven't had time to read this today only saw it today, and it's like it's really really long But as I said not light reading sit down with a coffee cup of tea whatever you drink Maybe a beer right on on the weekend. I'm in the weekends tomorrow off at least it is for me Oh, no, it is for everyone right like my weekends much closer. It's like 11 30 p.m.. Right now, but um And just read it right just read through it take it all in don't Kind of like feel bad if you don't get it the first read through as I said it's technical But if you do want to kind of like get really up to speed with everything you can do it And you can see at the top here to 52 minute read Maybe it takes you an hour to read it takes you a bit longer, but it's a good Saturday afternoon or something read I think I'm definitely gonna try and read it over the weekend That's for sure, but yeah, just wanted to highlight that and thanks to John for putting this together amazing work here All right so speaking of great work pseudo theosis put at another tweet thread all about the layer 3 paradigm shift in blockchain scaling so Obviously we'll link this thread in the YouTube description below for you to go check out But I've mentioned layer 3 scaling before it's something that stock ways been talking a lot about and I've said in the past that I think that The terminology like I don't know like I'm gonna capitulate and just start using this terminology The layer 3 terminology because people are just like more and more using it, but like we love to confuse people in crypto That's for sure, but at the end of the day Like the mass adoption and end users aren't really gonna care about terminology like this They're not gonna be talking about layer 1 layer 2 layer 3 layer 4 whatever They're just going to be like using the apps basically right so I wouldn't worry too much about that So but if you do want to learn about what layer 3 is from one of the kind of like best Twitter accounts that I follow Pseudo theos which you should be following by the way definitely kind of like check out this this Twitter thread For a kind of like a little break down here and then links to more information about this obviously mutable X being built with stock waste technology is using this stock ways been pushing it and Really I mean from what I've read and from the people I respect as well It really is a paradigm shift in blockchain scaling where layer 3 will still settle down to a theorem layer 1 But it goes to layer 2 to get to get down to layer 1 and it just gives us what I think people are calling Fractal scaling which I think poigneur had a thread about the other day I mean of course they have a thread about it But you can go check out there kind of like Twitter feed forum for that thread. I don't have it handy right now But yeah, I just want to kind of like highlight this thread from pseudo theos for you to go check out All right, so another update from immutable today. They've launched a meta mask mobile app support on the mutable X protocol So if you are using the immutable X kind of like protocol here the layer 2 network You can now use it with meta masks and mobile wallet apps So if you're using the mobile wallet app or meta mask well Then you can deposit withdraw ETH and a bunch of other tokens purchase and sell NFTs and manage your NFTs and you can try it now at this link Which of course I'll link in the YouTube description. I love seeing this You know we obviously need support from all wallets mobile desktop hardware Whatever it is for these layer 2 networks because that's the future of a theorem as you all well know I don't have to like I'm preaching to the choir by saying that but it is and I'm just glad to see more kind of like updates coming out of the immutable ecosystem here and they had a bunch of updates yesterday there more today They really kind of like I think getting into their stride now. I'm boarding a bunch of kind of I guess some Sorry, I'm boarding a bunch of teams doing a lot of business development behind the scenes Scaling more right working with stock where to scale even even more with layer threes and stuff like that doing the interoperable Interoperable liquidity for NFTs like they're killing it. I think at the moment I'm really excited for that for the future of immutable here. I mean I'm gonna I should disclose that I'm an investor in immutable, but I'm an investor because I was bullish on the project right I think a lot of people seem to think sometimes that people kind of like talk about their investments Because they want to shield them or they only invested in something because because they got a lot of money They want to show it like and they're not really bullish on it like no guys like I'm bullish on it like any Any project that I've kind of like invested in I kind of like I'm definitely bullish on right like I invest in because I have A thesis on it. I want to see it kind of like grower I want to see it succeed, but I just disclose for you guys because I just what I do on the show right? I always disclose my thing these things here, so I just wanted to get that out there But I mean again go check out this from immutable. I think it's a really cool little feature Alright finally here we have some I guess dramatic news or I guess like dramatic kind of like events happening right now So Leighton here from pull together put out a tweet thread by started by saying as some of you know I'm currently being sued personally in a putative is that supposed to be punitive punitive I don't know punitive class-action lawsuit I can't speak about it publicly because the litigation is ongoing, but I want to share some context and ask for your help So essentially what the lawsuit is is it's come from I think someone who is an ex-staff of Elizabeth Warren They deposited like $10 into pull together or something and now they've kind of like lobbied a lawsuit against Leighton personally For pull together now Obviously Leighton can't talk about the details of kind of like the case and everything like that so we don't have many kind of like details To go on here, but I think if you read between the lines and kind of like get underneath it You will really see that you're not going to be able to get a lawsuit I get underneath it you will realize that this isn't just kind of like attack on pull together This is an attack on all of the fire because it's it's a baseless lawsuit like it makes no sense Especially to go off to something like pull together, which is the probably the least d. Gen It's not even d. Gen like pro defy protocol in existence, and it's just Ridiculous that like someone would go after them, but I think there's ulterior motives here There's definitely kind of like an underscore of the wider day faker system here But the reason why this was brought up was also because Leighton's raising funds by kind of like selling NFTs in order to cover his legal expenses they've already I think spent a Considerable amount of money on on this. I'm not sure exactly how much I don't know if the number was actually named And it's probably going to cost them a considerable amount more I'm only learning this recently as well because I'm not familiar with the US legal system But apparently anyone can sue anyone for any reason in the u.s. Which I find incredibly bizarre and backwards, but it is what it is and obviously Kind of like legal help is not cheap, right? So I think it's going to run into the millions of dollars from from what I can tell in terms of legal costs to the For Leighton to defend himself against this and as I said, it's actually you know The thing is even if you don't like pull together for whatever reason I mean like it's kind of weird if you don't like pull Together even if you don't like Leighton I mean, I don't know the person the guy personally But um, you know for whatever like you in my mind, you should still like mince an NFT or make a donation disclosure I minted an NFT this one of the 0.1 eighth ones But you should still do it to support his fight in order to protect DeFi more broadly because if this person was to win their case against pull together It's it's a very bad precedent and very bad kind of like Like future I guess like precedent for the rest of DeFi So we have well, we don't want Leighton to lose this both obviously, I don't want him to lose it because it's a personal kind of like lawsuit and And it kind of like I don't want him to be kind of like hurt by that But also because of the kind of like wider implications for the DeFi space So anyway, I'm just kind of recommend not recommend But just like suggest if you guys do want to donate definitely go kind of like donate and mint an NFT or whatever And you can do that but basically From kind of kind of like from there Other other things you can do to support is kind of like retweet this share this talk about it Make sure that people know that this is a baseless kind of like lawsuit from from what you from what we can tell and it Doesn't actually make much much sense at all. Now. I don't know who's gonna win here I don't know if Leighton's gonna win. I don't know if this other person's gonna win But yeah We definitely need to be defending ourselves against attacks like this because they're gonna keep coming as I said guys like Regulations gonna ramp up especially in the wake of the terror collapse. It's coming like I mean, maybe we haven't heard much about over the last few weeks, but Trust me guys. It's coming like it's it's it's not like They're just gonna let that kind of like slide and people aren't and things aren't gonna be regulated now. It's coming unfortunately But the best thing we can do is I mean the first best thing we can do obviously is build truly decentralized applications that can't be stopped now that won't protect against people getting kind of like Getting sued personally, but we'll protect the actual protocol Second best thing we can do is basically prepare for these kinds of things right and kind of like come to terms with them But also educate regulators and educate lawmakers and educate politicians to make sure the regulation isn't to our owner s or isn't too kind of like harsh or anything like that and Actually makes sense because whether you guys like it or not doesn't matter what regulation it is It's coming like there is going to be some regulation of this industry now the places that they're going to regulate are as I've mentioned in the in the past the the kind of like part the It's the paths of least resistance stable coins the fiat on ramps You know centralized exchanges generally they're all just gonna kind of like get regulated to shit basically now there's good regulation in terms of kind of like stuff that doesn't hurt the industry and By that as much as I hate them like KYC AML I think is really dangerous in its own right, but that sort of stuff doesn't hurt the wider industry I don't think right, but what what would hurt the wider industry is if Exchanges were forced to not allow people to withdraw from the exchange to their own kind of like a theorem address for example That would definitely hurt the industry in a really really big way and would be very very bearish at least in the short to medium Term for anything got to do with on chain stuff Especially if that kind of regulation came from a country like the US so we don't want that happening But these other sorts of things like maybe you know requiring exchanges to report more stuff blah blah. I mean, it's already happening Maybe they just make it stricter Whatever like you you kind of like understand these things once you use a centralized exchange that this is all happening And that's as I said that doesn't affect really the broader. I like bull case for crypto because centralized exchanges I've always been regulated like this But something like banning you know or I guess like clamping down on stablecoin So the only whitelisted addresses can use stable coins on chain that again would hurt the ecosystem So we have to be mindful of that we have to kind of like fight against that sort of stuff But in general there's just you're naive to think that there's not going to be regulations There for sure is just need to make sure that they aren't too honor honor or harsh on the wider ecosystem There but it definitely goes support latent if you want to I'll link this in the YouTube description below I got a couple minutes left here There was one thing from the market talk that I didn't touch on that. I just wanted to quickly touch on here Guys, I've seen some of you talk about leverage in in the disco channel again Look, I'm not gonna tell you what to do with your money I'm not gonna give you investment advice But please understand what you're doing when you get on leverage like I don't know like maybe I maybe I warn about this too much Maybe I just sound like a kind of like angry parent not an angry parent But like an overly concerned parent at this at this point, right? I have seen too many people blow themselves up and then spiral into a depression I don't want that happening to you guys Do what you want with your money? Non-investment advice just general kind of advice of be careful with leverage Especially in markets like this where no one knows where it's gonna go. No one knows if it's the bottom No one knows if we're gonna bounce from here, you know, no one knows It's actually like like if you're gonna use leverage like this would probably be one of the worst times to use it And I don't think there's any good time to use leverage really But like this is probably like one of the worst in my opinion But again, like not investment advice guys, please don't take it as that just take it as general be careful Like it's super risky You can blow yourself up and the worst thing as I've said plenty of times the worst thing in Investing in crypto especially in crypto is blowing yourself up and then having to sit on the sidelines While everything just pumps and gets ahead of you Especially if you've been in it for a while for years and you just destroy your position before a new bull market starts I've seen this happen to multiple people. It's not good. Anyway, I'm gonna end it on that for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching Be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give the video a thumbs up subscribe to newsletter join This go channel and I'll catch you all next week. Thanks everyone

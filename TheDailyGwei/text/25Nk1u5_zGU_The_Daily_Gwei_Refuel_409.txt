 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Deligway Refuel where we cap the latest news near theorem ecosystem I'm your host Anthony Sassano and says at 19th of July 2022. Alright everyone. Let's get into it So the protocol guild is now being a vested out five by five hundred eighth Contribution from nouns down towards the pilot program. So this eighth will vest for one year directly to 116 protocol contributors, this is really cool I've talked about the protocol guild a lot on the refill before about how it's kind of this experiments in kind of raising eighth from different treasuries throughout I guess like the theorem ecosystem and Redirecting the eighth raised to I guess like protocol contributors core developers public goods on on aetherium So you can see here that it's a collective of 110 aetherium core protocol contributors, but I think that's gone up to 116 So this is basically getting kind of like eighth to the people that build the network essentially Right or kind of like help to build the network So very very cool to to see that this has started kind of vesting out here and this joins I guess All the others that are vesting out you can kind of like see a screenshot here of the others that are vesting out So there's uni LDO ENS and they're kind of like a tier from nouns down some other eighth are vesting out to these protocol contributors And it's not a poultry some it's worth a lot Right, like you can kind of like look at the UM the funds here across the different tokens You have three point five million dollars worth of uni two point eight million dollars with Lido Two point one million dollars worth of ENS and about eight more almost hundred thousand dollars worth of ETH here So very very cool to see this very cool to see that the core protocol contributors are getting rewarded for their work This is obviously being a kind of like issue within the theorem ecosystem for a little while like how do we find public goods sustainably and especially how to like we fund core developers because This is there's this common thing that gets brought up where it's like, okay Well people don't have incentive to work on the ethereum core protocol Because they know that they're not going to get kind of like a large allocation of ETH As kind of like a bonus or something like that because obviously the eighth market cap is much bigger There is no kind of like pre-sales or no private rounds to come and like it like with a new New layer one and when you join, I mean you could join the ethereum foundation You probably have some ETH getting and invested out to you there from a bonus structure or something like that I'm not entirely sure but generally it's just much harder to get your hands on some ETH here or some kind of like Money for for your work. So it obviously would pay more to go work for another layer one And the you know, this this does happen Like people do go work for other layer ones because it's just kind of more worth their wild money wise But I think that you know just looking at that problem and thinking that it's not you know Not something that should be solved is obviously a not the right way to go about it So that's where things like it coin came in just public woods in general came into the picture and obviously the protocol guild now Has come in and basically said well no, we need to make sure that we can fund the kind of like future of aetherium core protocol development and and and just anyone who contributes to the core protocol and just anyone who contributes to public woods on aetherium more generally and they they should be Able should be rewarded for the value that they're driving to the network because when you really think about it You know We all talk about how big of a catalyst the merge is for the price of ETH Well think about all the people that are working on the merge working to make it a reality You know, I would wager that like a decent amount of them have very little ETH because they just came in much later they weren't able to purchase much because maybe they didn't have much money to begin with and They're contributing in a really really positive way but they aren't really seeing the I guess like rewards for that contribution just because there is no kind of like central entity besides maybe the aetherium foundation that has the ETH to kind of like A spare here and the aetherium foundation does a lot don't get me wrong. They give a lot of kind of like money away through grants programs and things like that But in terms of getting it to core protocol developers or core protocol contributors in general The protocol guild kind of stepped up and said, you know, let's do this kind of pilot program Let's see how it goes and let's see if we can continue because at the end of the day getting a small percentage of the treasuries on aetherium is a really great way to go about it because These treasuries and these tokens and these products really live or die on aetherium based on all the work that's been done up until that point the work that's been done in the future to improve the protocol and to kind of like make sure the protocol doesn't just Basically fall over through all the core development work that's been done. So very cool to see this I'm glad that the contributors are getting rewarded at just as they should Alright, so an announcement out of obel labs today So they have announced the onboarding to their first public test net for at home validators are known as Athena so the Athena test net is kind of like now live and if you're an at-home validator and you want to Contribute or participate in this public test net you can there's a whole thread about this and a blog post, of course So for just a quick recap of what obel network is trying to do they're trying to enable something called distributed validator technology So what they're building out right now is a distributed validator middleware client And kind of have been running dev nets and obviously now a test net for this So basically what DVT or distributed distributed validator technology allows everyone to do is allows one aetherium validator To run across multiple machines in theory. All these machines could be controlled by a single entity However, we aspire to use DVT amongst groups where a combination of operators collaborate to run aetherium validators The obel network aims to foster trust minimize staking in groups to enable people to create test run and coordinate distributed validators with that in mind this in the future test net to acquire groups of humans to collaborate together to run nodes and then it Kind of goes through the different phases of how this is all going to work Which you can check out our link in the YouTube description below now This goes to what I was saying yesterday about how we def obviously need more competition And more kind of like players in the aetherium staking ecosystem and and just ways for people to stake without that 32th requirement And obel is one of the things that will be able to How to like enable that enable to people to stake in groups, you know This technology can be used by kind of like other services such as rocker pool and lido and things like that as well Which is very very cool kind of like stacks on top of it as it is a middleware client So we can kind of run there You know another example of a middleware client that basically runs on anything or middleware protocol that runs on anything is chain link, right? It's like an Oracle service No, it's not just an Oracle service but obviously most of the uses is kind of like in the oracles today and that sits kind of like in the middle and just Powers so much of of defi out there. So that's a good way to think about it But yeah for those of you who've been paying attention to this project You should definitely check out this thread and maybe even get involved with the public test net if you're an at-home validator to kind of You know help them along with their testing here There's the thread and the blog post obviously which I'll be linking in the YouTube description below for you to check out Alright an announcement or a big announcement out of scroll today and I'll read out the announcement first I don't want to give some more thoughts here But basically the announcement reads after over a year of building our zk EVM based zk roll-up in close collaboration with the privacy scaling Group at the Ethereum Foundation We are releasing the pre alpha version of scroll for external testers and this thread goes through kind of like what you'll be able to Do with this but before I dive into the details here I just want to kind of like note the scaling Wars are getting more and more heated by the day Especially when it comes to zk EVM stuff. I've talked about zk EVM at length in a recent refill So I won't rehash what I said there but guys like zk EVM definitely seems like a holy grail thing and it seems like There's so many teams working on it now and so many teams wanting to get a production ready zk VM out that we're going to get it much sooner than we otherwise would off which is obviously really really bullish I'm super excited for that but in terms of scrolls implementation here there, you know They're trying to invite as many testers as possible While they drive towards kind of like their public release You can sign up if you want to be an early tester at sign up the scroll dot IO and you know What is it what is included in this pre alpha alpha test net? Well, they continue by saying this initial release we run on a private POA fork of aetherium the test net l1 Operated by scroll on top of this private chain We will run a test net scroll l2 supporting the following features Users will be able to play with a few key demo apps such as a uniswap fork with a familiar web interfaces such as metamask Very very cool. Our users will be able to view the state of the scroll test net via block explorers Obviously awesome to have that from the get-go Scroll will run a node that supports unlimited read operations eg getting the state of accounts and user initiated transactions involving interactions with the pre deployed demo apps eg transfers at the I say 20 tokens or swaps of tokens and Before rollers will generate and aggregate validity proofs for part of the zkavm circuits to ensure a stable release in the next test net phase We'll be ramping up this set of zkavm circuits Five bridging assets between these test net l1 and l2 will be enabled through a smart contract bridge though arbitrary message passing will not be supported in this release Scrolls pre alpha test net will be the first chance for early users and developers to interact with our infrastructure and Experience dap workflows on a scroll. This is a pretty big release for a pre alpha test net I would say like you usually don't see things like block explorers being released with something that is considered pre alpha like pretty Pretty alpha is pretty funny because it I mean obviously it goes like, you know alpha beta I mean kind of a kind of like a main net production a pre alpha means this is kind of like the you know Very still very very early early stages here, but if this is what early stages looks like for scroll I'm excited to see what they've you know Alpha and beta looks like because they have a lot of features here from the get-go that I haven't seen from other pre alpha Even alpha deployments of of similar to assume a kind of like technologies here. So I'm very very excited for this I definitely kind of like signed up. I want to get my hands on this when I can But yeah, as I was saying like the zkavm stuff, I definitely expect to see much more movement here Especially like I mean, I think tomorrow. Yeah tomorrow at about 1 p.m. Paris time is polygons announcement. So I'm curious to see what kind of like comes out of that, but it's heating up very very quickly guys Like I think that by the end of this year, we could possibly see a zkavm ready for you know Maybe maybe it's in alpha or beta still but we could see a zkavm deployed to main net ethereum Where developers can actually start building on top of it and users can basically use it maybe in a limited fashion But still like that would be huge like to give some context people didn't expect a full-blown zkavm to actually be live until maybe 2023 maybe more likely 2024 if we can get it by the end of 2022 That is a huge leap in kind of like scalability here, which I think is just absolutely awesome, right? I think it's a an awesome achievement if we can get that done and it speaks to the level of kind of I guess builders We have building layer 2 technologies. They really are some of the best builders in this ecosystem. Anyway, I'm gonna leave it at that for now But definitely check this out. If you haven't yet, you can go to sign up those scroll dot IO to sign up for the pre-alpha testnet All right. So spruce put out an update today saying eip 4361 are signed in with ethereum has now moved from draft to review as an eip This is a huge step in moving sign in with ethereum forward as a widely adopted standard Now with the eip kind of like standards here. These do need to kind of like go into a hard fork So there's two different stance. I mean, there's two different ways to kind of like get something adopted I'm kind of like the standard side or kind of like the I guess like protocol side of things is the ERCs Which is kind of like an ethereum request for comments Which I mean you're familiar with the ERC 20 and the ERCs for NFTs. They don't require hard forks to be implemented into the network They're basically just a standard that people can follow when developing like a token for example And anyone can come up with their own standards, so it doesn't require a hard fork But an eip does again eip requires a kind of inclusion in a hard fork with you know That'll obviously be in a future hard fork and its inclusion in a hard fork depends on how much utility It's actually going to add to the network and how much overhead it's going to add to I guess like core developers to build it out and you know There are always a IPS that just don't make it in because it's just too much work to be done It just keeps getting pushed back because there's just more interesting stuff and more pressing stuff that needs to be included But yeah, a IP kind of for 361 the sign in with ethereum eip I think is one that is definitely very very important and you can kind of go read the whole specification here It does get quite technical, but you can read it for yourself and kind of like how it would improve things But yeah, we'll see when this gets included I mean you guys know that there's going to be a hard fork after the merge called Shanghai We don't know what's going to be included with Shanghai yet I would bet that withdrawals for the beacon chain are definitely going to be in that hard fork But it remains to be seen if the core developers decide that they want to do withdrawals in its own standalone hard fork And then all the other kind of like EIPs that want to Go into the network or at least a lot of them such as proto dank sharding to be in another hard fork shortly after that Maybe three months after that or something like that I can see that happening because stuffing everything into the same hard fork or network upgrade I mean it does bow There's kind of like put more complexity into one thing which means that we could be increasing the attack service and the security concerns So it may be maybe worth just kind of like enabling withdrawals for the beacon chain for staked 8th, right? For rewards in its own standalone fork and then three ish months later We do the kind of like proto dank sharding and we do maybe be up here You know sign them with aetherium here and a bunch of others out there that have been trying to get into the network But it's always hard to know exactly where it's going to go It just it really does depend on resources and kind of a complexity at the end of the day a quarter of Albus have to build Out this stuff they have to test that they have to make sure it's all secure and the more of these things you stuff into One never cup grade the more chance there is for something to go wrong, you know post that upgrade So you definitely want to keep the complexity down to a minimum especially for a theorem for a network like aetherium where it's huge Right has so many people using it It's not like we can move fast anymore and obviously we don't move fast within the aetherium layer one ecosystem And that's why you know getting a IPs into the network is very very difficult takes forever I mean if you want five five nine the most popular EIP EIP in a theorem's history Which also, you know fundamentally changed the way theorems fee market worked But that still took like two and a half years from a neutral draft or initial specification To going into the the network on mainnet So that's just give you a bit of context around how long these things can take and why you know People shouldn't really rely on these things to happen in a speedy manner now Hopefully we can kind of like speed that up as time goes on Hopefully it doesn't take that long because I think during that period was obviously the bear market There was kind of like less people working on stuff But as the aetherium network grows It just naturally becomes a slower process to get upgrades in Because the core developers and researchers wants to be able to take a more measured approach to things make sure that they you know They're not putting any major bugs into the network or they're not adding any necessary complexity and there are Definitely like a higher there is a hierarchy of things at the end of the day that were going in like there are things that Definitely need to go in such as proto dank sharding like we need scale for layer twos Obviously we need to kind of like we need sharding like it's simple as that. It's definitely overdue at this stage So that is that and and beacon chain withdrawals is pretty much the top priority post merge as well So there are things that take priority here for obvious reasons But then you know depending on kind of like how much improvement it can bring how much people kind of like want it and how Much overall I guess complexity it adds to the network that also plays into things So we'll see how that goes. But yeah good to see this moving from the kind of like a draft to review stage now for those Of you don't know what the EIP kind of like stage looks like There are a bunch of stages that has to go through Like the whole governance process all the kind of like different EIP Stages on github and things like that like it's a whole thing. Like you should go to a theorem.org I'm pretty sure they have a guide to this I can't remember all the stages off the top of my head But I'm pretty sure they have like an explanation of how this all works It's but it's not like she's not looking to propose an EIP and then they say okay I want it in this hard block and it just happens. No like that. That's not the process at all Like it's it's it's a very long RDS kind of like pros it process that is Is definitely something that is not for the faint of heart. That's for sure But yeah, you can go to a theorem.org and I think they've got a section on that there Alright, so a couple of synthetics updates from the weekend. So this one is a thread. What is synthetics v3 and why is important? Let's get into it and then they start by saying synthetics v3 aims to accomplish what synthetics set out to do many years ago Transforming the protocol into a permissionless derivatives platform. How will synthetics get to v3 a thread so you can check out this thread I won't go through everything. Basically. This is really really great There's a lot of reading here for you guys to do but if you are bullish on synthetics like I am Definitely worth checking out here I said before on the refill I think synthetics is finally able being you know I've been able over the last few months or last six months at least to Realize their vision a lot more because of the fact that they are able to scale by optimism They're getting a lot more usage. I'm sure you've all seen it You know They're generating a lot of fear of a new which is obviously a really really great sign to see and they have a strong community Backing them as well and a long-term community like these people that have been part of this in today's community I've stuck around for a long time and whenever I see that I get more bullish on a project now I don't own any SNX tokens currently and this is obviously not me trying to Pump any bags or anything like that? But there are so many shitty projects in crypto so many so much short-term value extraction happening And I feel like when I see a project that has been around for a long time that has a really dedicated community That he's still building that he's kind of like building products It will actually want to use I feel like it's worth Kind of highlighting those products rather than just skimming over and being like I don't want to say anything because I don't want to be Pumping anything up. It's got nothing to do with the SNX token so to do with the fact that we need to be more I guess like conscious of these builders and kind of praise them for it like The funniest thing the grand irony is that the kind of like terror ecosystem DoKwon and terra form arms and whatever they got all this praise all this praise right and the people kind of and there were a Lot of people who got a lot of shit from that community such as the mega community You know the terror community said I'm gonna kill die USC is gonna overtake a ball of blood and then terror collapses and that's obviously great a vindication for these other teams that were kind Of like copping shit from the the lunar army or whatever they were called the lunatics But the problem is is that we shouldn't just wait for something to collapse wait for something to die We should still constantly be kind of like tying these people Hey, like what you're building is really really cool and kind of like supporting them and being part of their communities Because as at the end of the day these people are people guys like devs and builders They're people and they have to put up with a lot of shit like it's not easy building in DeFi building in crypto building just you know in a theorem generally it is actually quite hard It takes a lot of grit to do it There's a lot of grit to stick to the same thing as well like Cain from synthetics has copped a bit of shit before I Remember him and suzou going at it, which is hilarious now because in there he's got the cane got the last laugh here But I remember Cain copying a bit of shit about kind of like you know selling some s and X tokens buying some some Sydney side property and all these sorts of other stuff whatever I have no opinion on that, but the thing is is that Cain is still building guys like he's still building He's still down in the trenches He's still part of the synthetics ecosystem And he's also building a bunch of other things as well. It's not like he's just rode off into the sunset with the money He made and decided to kind of like exit this ecosystem That's not what he did at all so the fact that he's still there still building up to so so long is Obviously a very positive sign as well I would think but he's not the only one obviously has a team that kind of like works with him a lot of people that Have worked on synthetics over the years as well, and there is that community there, too So I'm super excited for synthetics v3 and kind of like the path towards getting there I know I've also been excited to see them kind of gain some actual traction on Optimism over the last six months and it seems to be sustainable traction because we know that you know these layer twos are obviously where? We're going to scale They get better with time. They're nowhere near what they can kind of scale to so that's obviously very exciting It's not going to be a problem Or I guess scale isn't going to be a problem for synthetics going forward, so that's the first update there There's also a second update here that the s usd bridge is now live so the most used stablecoin on Optimism I just got a lot better users can now move s usd to and from optimism to the ethereum main net both directions have been switched On so very cool to say there's some more interoperability between ethereum main net and optimism for the s usd token Which I haven't verified this but if what synthetics is saying is true that s usd is the most used stablecoin on optimism That is a pretty good or I guess like pretty Impressive achievement there because that means it would be more used than die and usd t and usd C Which is definitely you know much more used on main net than s usd But I think that's just a function of the fact that synthetics on the ethereum main net suffered a lot because of the scaling issues But now on Optimism they are succeeding a lot more so I'd love to see that But you can go check out both of these updates. I'll link them in the YouTube description below All right, so a new release here from the gnosis guild so they've released something called blogs for dow's Which is called tabula so it's born out of an impromptu gnosis guild hackathon So dow's and multi-sigs and any ethereum based account can now own publications together. That's really cool I think that is something that doesn't exist within the kind of I guess like web 3 ecosystem right now So I guess the tldr here is that you can imagine a dow being the kind of like top level owner of a publication So for example you could sign permissions to people within the dow and they could kind of like own this entire publication Such as like a I mean you can't do this on medium or Mira or kind of like sub stack one of those platforms But you can imagine those same platforms Built on something like tabula here where or tabula I think that I think you say it is tabula here That you can basically connect your wallet to just sign in with ethereum And if you're part of the dow you'll be able to kind of I guess like you know be the top level account of that Publication so that's very very cool. This is definitely web 3 stuff It's not deeper or anything like that, and this is the sort of stuff that I want to see more of because it kind of I guess Uses the existing I guess like what was the word I'm looking for existing infrastructure primitives functionality within crypto within ethereum And takes it to the next level and and kind of I guess like introduces a feature set that hasn't been available is not available At this point in time so this is very cool And the fact that it came out of a impromptu little gnosis guild hackathon here is also very very cool So you can read this thread for more details on this and check out the website. I'll link it in the YouTube description below All right, so I mentioned I think last week on the refill that do not a leaks now supports arbitrum data So they put out a thread yesterday show showcasing the top 10 arbitrum dashboards so fast You can kind of like scroll through these yourself to check out all of them But just to give you I guess like a taste of what there is there's an arbitrum overview dashboard from super What's this from spring zhang here? There's an arva dashboard from six degree lab gmx dashboard Odyssey dashboard and I mean just 10 dashboards right like as I said at the start so you can check them all out But I do want to kind of like just showcase the arbitrum overview here because obviously that is going to give us a top-level Overview of what arbitrum looks like you can see total transactions total accounts total contracts. You know transaction count monthly obviously They had the Odyssey events so that kind of like spiked up there But I had to pause that so it's come down and you can see here our transactions weekly showcase the same thing I could use it. I could use it weekly monthly. You know all the kind of stats. I mean there's so many stats I'm not going to read them all out. You can go check that check it out I'll link it in the description, but very very cool to see this I love keeping track of these metrics guys like I'm always looking at metrics I used to actually another I think about it. I think I stopped making these videos are quite a while ago now But there was a daily gray series that I did called the daily grade data pump where I looked at all these metrics and I Basically went through them all but the reason why I stopped that series Was the fact that there was just too much data to go through I didn't feel like I could adequately cover it cover all of It and I don't quickly kind of like pull the alpha out of it Given the fact that there's just so much kind of like data out there now There is one tool that I think say a lot of people talking about little using called Danson In addition to doing analytics, which you know I mean there's Nansen to analytics. There's the block has the data platform There's coin metrics. There's um. There's glass node. There's so many of these platforms. I just can't keep up with it Just just too many and to me dashboards on these platforms So I recommend just for yourselves going through these other things you can just go to doings website or Nansen or anything like that And go through the data yourself and kind of see what you actually want to pay attention to Rather than someone reading it to you I believe there might be some youtubes that youtubers out there that look at this kind of like data And they try to get like trading insights from it I don't actually think you can get trading insights from a lot of that data I think for me. I just look at it as a curiosity thing to say okay. How is this thing growing? You know is it actually being sustainable? You know how many users has it got how many transactions? You know what's the fees like sort of those sorts of things? I'm not looking at these sorts of stuff and being like okay Well, I can see this is growing so I'm going to make a bet here You know an investment bet you could for sure use it for that But my investment bets usually are not based on these sorts of things they're based on on I mean they are and they aren't like I definitely look at protocol usage and stuff like that obviously because that that kind of is how you see product market fit But I've explained before how there is a very Kind of like egregious thing that happens in crypto where something can look like it has product market fit for a very long time You know during a bull market and then it just die off and it becomes like a really bad investment Like you maybe you invested in it thinking this is awesome this growth is going to continue It's all going to be well and good and then it just doesn't and the protocol dies and you've just kind of like you know Lost money on your investment, so I look at obviously the on-chain stuff obviously the protocol metrics and stuff like that But I also look at a bunch of other things that and the same thing I look at every investment You know a team what's the team like what's the actual product like like okay? The product is popular now, but is it sustainable right and what's the team likely can they actually build this thing? You know why they got are they kind of like builders that will build through a brutal bear market like stuff like that like I'm not gonna go through all the things I look at but it's a lot more than just on chain stuff You can't rely on on chain stuff for everything and especially for the more established things like there was a lot of people Going on about like Bitcoin on chain metrics back when Bitcoin was at like 30 40 50 K And then it kind of like came down from there very very hard And it's just funny how like you know people they kind of capitulated on that and they're like oh, okay Well, you know now the on-chain data is kind of like saying that it's a screaming buy here, and but I was like okay Well you were saying was a screaming buy at this level too like you just it's it's impossible to just look at On-chain data and kind of like get an actual investing insight from it that is good for the long term I think you have to take everything holistically if it was that easy if you could just look at the on-chain data and get a Long term investment out of it then everyone would do it and then the alpha would funny enough go away if everyone was doing it Right, but I anyway. I'm gonna leave it at that you can check out these dashboards all link in the YouTube description below And speaking of arbitrum the transaction street dot-com website here now has arbitrum alive So you can basically visualize what the arbitrum transactions are what where they're coming from kind of like what gas they're paying The transactions a second that's happening on the network all that good stuff by going to TX Street comm slash-v a slash eighth dot dash RB sorry so you can kind of like launch it here I mean you probably see it on my screen Yeah, you can see kind of like on the on the left hand side here kind of like what's happening I think this this is kind of like a theory I'm there and that's main Arbitrum on the right hand side so if you click up here you can see the different networks and toggle the views behind it So I just want to see kind of like the arbitrum Street I can and kind of like see all the people queuing up and things like that On arbitrum side on the left and then the etherium side on the right so there's a cool way to visualize transactions I'm sure some of you have seen this before But definitely go check it out if you haven't yet. I'll link in the new description below Finally here we have a major announcement out of Lido today They are launching st Eth on layer 2 so Lido stickers will soon be able to use their st assets in defy on layer 2 They seem to be going to support like every layer 2 network I think they're going to be Basically like every layer 2 network you see Maybe listed on l2b is what they want to support and any others in the future that come online They're going to want to support those as well so very cool to see this obviously This is something that is going to be able to expand the stake a theorem staking ecosystem Through Lido and be able to expand kind of like the users that will be able to access this sort of stuff obviously Trying to kind of like get exposure to st Eth on main net has been cumbersome because it's been expensive but With this improvement coming you'll be able to access it on any number of layer twos on on a theorem Which is very very cool to see so you can read their blog post for more details about this And they I think they've got a little thread here as well if you want to and they're also going to be starting a new Kind of like series called L Tuesday's which Which I think like when I say it out loud I get it like L2 Tuesday's right But L Tuesday's like just seeing it written out here is just a weird thing to me until I actually said it out loud I'm like why is it called L Tuesday's and I'm like oh wait L2 Tuesday's L Tuesday's okay I get it now like but this reading like it without kind of like saying it out loud I was kind of like confused by it, but anyway. That's a pointless thing I don't even know why I was talking about that, but anyway They've got this new series called L Tuesday's happening every Tuesday where they talk to different like layer two teams in the Ethereum ecosystem So be sure to kind of like get set a reminder for those It's going to be happening on Twitter spaces you can go check that out I'll link it in the YouTube description, but on that note. I'm gonna stop rambling. That's it for today Thank everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet Give it a thumbs up subscribe to newsletter join the disco channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow.

 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily grey refuel where we cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host Dan this is Sano and this is 16th of August 2022. Alright everyone. Let's get into it So another 24 hours worth of I guess discussion around tornado cache Censorship all those sorts of things that I guess I spoke about in the refill yesterday now I'm gonna be talking about that for a little while here on the refill again today I think this is very important there are time stamps if you just want to skip to some of the news from the day But I think it pretty much like what has everyone's attention right now is this kind of is this kind of censorship stuff, right? There's not really much else that's getting kind of got most people's attention, and I'm not even just walking within a theory I'm talking like all across crypto right so I put this tweet out today Which I think sets the the tone of what I want to talk about where I said I want to be very clear on this if the ethereum base layer ends up engaging in Permanent and permanent is the kind of opportune word here Permanent censorship, then I will consider the ethereum experiment a failure, and I will move on Thankfully I believe the ethereum community is strong enough to fight off base layer censorship now I'm not going to rehash what I said yesterday But I really do mean this guys like if for some reason the ethereum base layer engages in permanent censorship meaning that there are addresses on the network that permanently cannot be interacted with due to Validators kind of like post merge censoring those addresses or censoring those kind of like smart contracts or anything like that I will consider that to be an epic failure of ethereum to be honest and ethereum is an experiment right so is Bitcoin like all This is an experiment none of this is guaranteed to work, but we obviously are all betting that it will But I would I would leave and I wouldn't move on to another crypto because there's actually nothing else that interests me like ethereum does Not even close and certainly not Bitcoin like some of the I said in my second tweet here some of the bitcoin is we're doing victory laps And I said you know bitcoin is prone to the same censorship risk as ethereum is it doesn't matter if it's pure of stake or Proof of work and if I left ethereum I wouldn't be moving to Bitcoin I'd rather leave the industry entirely than do that and the reason why is because I believe bitcoins social layer is fundamentally broken And I don't want to be part of that. I would actually hate myself being part of that community I look at it, and I'm just like I don't understand how anyone can be part of it I feel dumber every time I read anything coming out of that community so without ranting too much there I wouldn't go to Bitcoin and there's nothing as I said there's nothing else that would actually Interest me or that actually has my attention like ethereum does So I would move on I would just leave the industry and I think that's true for a lot of people we are in this To make ethereum the thing that succeeds for a multitude of different reasons I've gone through plenty of them over the years on the refill, so I'm not going to rehash that here But the good thing is as I said I think the community and the social layer that we have is strong enough to fight off this base layer censorship I think that there are a multitude of things we can do to fight this from social signaling which we've been doing a lot of lately to Technology kind of like improvements such as PBS and CR lists and other things that I've spoken about before So I don't think the risk is very high here of permanent censorship at the base layer And all the other layers guys like they're gonna have to work on in parallel like I'm not gonna leave the ethereum Ecosystem because some front end decided to censor what they're what they're allowing users to do that as I explained yesterday There are different levels here right the different kind of like layers to it all I care about In a kind of like in a maximalist way is the base layer everything else built on top, right? We can it's a much easier to decentralize that then it is the base layer the base layer is actually quite hard to Decentralize and keep decentralized especially when you have kind of like big entities in control of a lot of stake And a lot of mining power and this is what I mean by like Bitcoin and ethereum being similar in censorship risk It doesn't matter if it's mining or staking at the end of the day if you have large entities in control of a large amount Of the stake or hash power they can engage in relatively easy censorship Whether they want to do it or whether they're being kind of forced to do it by a nation-state, so I just don't understand Why Bitcoin is don't make this connection? Maybe they do and they just don't want to make the connection because it makes a theorem look good I don't know, but that's that that's setting the tone for the rest of stuff They want to talk about but there is an update here I guess our blog post that our coin Center put out around the tornado cash stuff with with with oFAC You should definitely go give this a read It's not too long of a rate But it gives a lot of good context around this and why coin Center believes that what oFAC has done is actually unconstitutional And potentially kind of like illegal and can be challenged in the courts Which is what I think coin Center is setting up to do which is what we want to see right we want to see this Challenge in the courts and we want to basically set precedents here that you know we already have precedent. We already have This in kind of like in the law that basically said says that code is speech and speech is protected by the Constitution in the US so if Cody's speech then you're not you know you you couldn't you can't sanction code right? That's the whole argument basically distilled down into the TLDR This is going as I said this is before as I've said before this is gonna have to be fought in the courts This is not something that's gonna play out overnight And this is a fight that the whole of crypto is kind of like fighting Bitcoin a theorem every other chain out there It's just that a theorem is as I explained yesterday Gone to the point where it actually kind of like is a concern or a threat to nation states And they're sanctioning it like I don't understand why that's actually a black mark on a theorem That's actually a huge validation of a theorem as a technology and as a as a kind of like as a platform of what we're trying To build it. We're trying to build things that give people more freedom right and I know people will make the argument that not I'm gonna cash was used for money laundering it or is used by North Korea and all this sort of stuff That's orthogonal to the point that I'm making the point that I'm making is that we've actually been able to create tools that are Literally unstoppable like tornado cash is still running on the ethereum network It is still immutable right the contract is still there. You can still interact with it if you want to You know yes, okay? You run the risk if you're a US person's obviously of up to 30 years in prison and all these fines But the point is is that it's still there right the point It isn't that like the I guess like meatspace law is restricting you Nothing is restricting you from kind of like interacting with it on the technology side And as I said like earlier the base layer censorship is the only thing that could stop you from using it if it was kind of like a permanent thing that most of the network was Complicit in most of the validators, but complicit in but we have a whole social layer And we have like a whole kind of like thing a social contract behind that that Doesn't guarantee, but gives you really high insurances Assurances that a theorem is going to be censorship Resistant as I said the same is true for Bitcoin the same is true for all the other change It's just what degree there is here people will say oh You know proof of stake and is kind of more centralizing and less than she persistent than proof of work I think that's kind of like orthogonal because for example And I don't actually don't think it makes sense at all you could have a blockchain that has one minor on it right one kind Of like entity mining the entire chain well You know it doesn't matter if it was proof of work or proof of stake They could censor like that being in control of the whole chain right so it's all about how much the stake or hash power is Distributed with Bitcoin there is a few mining pools that can if they wanted to I'm not saying they're going to do this But if they wanted to they could censor transactions right if they were forced to they could censor transactions Yes, miners can change pools right, but that's the same in staking yes, a coinbase could censor transactions Yes, Binance could but once withdrawals are enabled users can unstake and go stake somewhere else That's not censoring them right and obviously I guess I'm putting your stake into centralized providers Is a risk that you take on as well just like if you're renting hash power from someone That's a risk to write you're giving your money to someone and if they don't kind of like mine for you Or if they kind of like just take the money and run that's that's a risk there as well So there is all this kind of like Risks associated with things that you do when you kind of like delegating your hash or delegating your stake That you have to kind of like take into consideration That's why I'm always a big advocate of solo staking or taking through decentralized kind of pools and things like that So I just wanted to kind of clarify that as well there But yeah go give this blog post to read a link in the YouTube description below The next thing I wanted to talk about was this poll that Eric wall put out today, which I think was really great He said question for the Ethereum community if a majority of stake chooses a in this poll Will you consider the censorship and attack? Essentially consider the censorship and attack on aetherium and burn their stake via social consensus Which is option X option Y is tolerate the censorship and he's quote tweeting left Eris here Who kind of like has I think I don't know if there's a poll here or basically There's a kind of like a question here that says in a question for all the major staking providers if regulators ask you to Sense out at the etherium protocol level with your validators Will you comply and censor at the protocol level or shut down the staking service and prefer preserve the network integrity? So if they choose a comply and censor at the protocol level Would we consider this a censorship attack on a theorem and burn the stake via social consensus? This is what I talked about yesterday basically social slashing or would we tolerate it and the poll I mean overwhelmingly Is in favor of X right like you can see here that why I mean there is a short results option for people that obviously Didn't want to vote for X or Y But just looking at X or Y in a vacuum you can see that X is at 61.8 percent and Y is at 9.3 percent so overwhelmingly the Ethereum community is in kind of like in in favor of Considering this a censorship attack and burning the stake via social consensus and this brings up interesting questions about what these staking service providers Would do let's take Coinbase as a prime example here because they're a US based exchange and they have a lot of stake Delegated to them or they have a lot of state kind of like In they have a lot of control of a lot of valet is to use a stake if they were forced to buy the US Government what right now the sanctions on tornado cash don't force them to do this But let's just say in the future They were forced to do this if they were forced by the US government to censor transactions at the protocol level with using their validator share And they kind of like started doing this and the community has socially signaled and told them hey if you do this We're going to slash you like we are literally going to come together And we're going to slash you and kick you out of the network because what you're doing is an attack on the Ethereum protocol That social signal there is extremely powerful It depends how seriously coinbase takes that but I think the Ethereum community is big enough and out and kind of like The social signaling is enough especially from key players in the ecosystem That this is definitely something that coinbase is probably looking at now and being like okay Well, this is something that we have to consider if if this happens So if they're being forced to buy the US government they have another choice They don't have to do the censorship they can basically turn their validators off They can just shut them down now obviously given their share of the network this would result in what's called a quadratic inactivity Leak which means that they wouldn't just be leaking out a for being offline They would be leaking out a lot of eight because a lot of validators went offline at the same time and then they would eventually get kicked out of the validator set and To re-enter they would have to wait to withdrawals and all that sorts of stuff and their validators will just become useless they have To eat that loss as well, and that's not their loss as their customer loss So they'd have to pay for that so there is a business case here as well for coinbase not to engage in this censorship So you can see that these discussions don't really get had on Twitter the Twitter lacks all this nuance There's so much that goes into this guys. It's it's actually such a complex kind of like Ecosystem here that I think people look at Twitter look at these kind of like one-liners that people put out and be like oh if you Miss centralized it's gonna be sent. It's gonna get censored blah blah blah when in reality the kind of like The thing is it much more nuanced than that and I'm trying to explain the nuance as best I can and I'm doing this without a script or anything so I'm obviously missing things But I think that it's very very important to keep that in mind is that the social layer is our last line of defense We will do social kind of like Slashing if we have to write if we can see that there is censorship going on if it's proved beyond a doubt Which is not hard to prove because we know kind of what validators belong to what entities Then we can get together as a community and say okay. Here is a you know pull request whatever it is to slash Kind of this actor because they're engaging in censorship And then the rest of the network can come together to do that now what coin best risk their business for that because they you know That's that's their customers eat. That's not their eight, so would they risk their business to do that I don't think so I think coin base would either Push their valid as offline if they're being forced to censor or they would fight the censorship They would fight the US government on that and they might even take it to court right they had they have you know a huge Legal team and things like that maybe they do that because it's not just a theorem It's at risk at every single staking provider that they have That's that's the risk and even if they have like a mining pool which actually I believe some exchanges Do there's the same thing right if they run a mining pool so from that point of view? Keeping up the social signaling is extremely important talking about these things is extremely important And that's why I put out this tweet as well where I said you know theorems will always ask and respond to the hardest Questions we don't bury them below ten layers of psi ops and propaganda And we certainly don't pretend that a theorem is perfect if there is and will continue to be stronger for embracing this culture Now I'm obviously well Maybe not as obviously but I'm referencing Bitcoin here because the Bitcoin community tends to bury things beneath Narratives beneath psi ops beneath propaganda because they don't actually want to openly talk about the issues Let's take the issue of their security budget the long-term security budget for years and years I've been talking about this many in the community have been talking about this some even in the Bitcoin community have been talking about this How in a couple more? Harvenings the Bitcoin blockchain it very very much runs the risk of becoming insecure Because fear of a new isn't making up for the lack of block reward or for the kind of like dwindling block block reward What did the Bitcoin community do they buried this they said it was bullshit? They said it was fun. They they literally count with propaganda I have a thread that I kind of like have with Dan Heddle Dan held from 2019 or 2020 where he was literally sharing with me Charts that he had drawn Predicting that the fear of and you would go up. It was a prediction He was sharing them with me as if they were fact so literally like that That's how far they went to bury this right if there is don't do that. We talk openly about this because it is Paramount that we attack this head-on. There's no point burying it What what what would burying it achieve because if we bury this if we say oh, no censorship isn't gonna happen There's no risk of this happening. We're fine We're just gonna rely on you know rely on on all the steak is being honest and not censoring all that sorts of stuff No, that's that's not how it works at all and burying it would result in a very very kind of like weak social layer It would result in actual censorship at the base layer And then the people that kind of like are in this ecosystem that want to see Ethereum be the most sensitive resistant network in crypto would probably leave It's not just me guys like I guarantee you a lot of the people in Ethereum like as I am and I'm not just talking about you know they bought some eat they hold it Maybe they use some apps. I'm talking about the Strongest part of the social layer the core developers the core researchers the core community members They would seriously have a crisis of confidence in a theorem if there was permanent censorship at the base layer But I'm not the only one so how do we fight this well? We talk openly about it We make sure that it is known that hey if you engage in censorship We're going to slash you like it simple as that and I think that bitcoin is look at that open honesty Especially the bitcoin maximalists, and they're not used to it. They're not used to everything being laid bare So they automatically say oh look at look at this look at how openly they're talking about it look They're even admitting that there's a risk of this happening It's like yeah, because like there is a risk of this happening the risk is there for bitcoin as well But it's just because you guys don't admit that it's there doesn't mean it doesn't exist I refuse to bury my head in the sand on this and I refuse to give in to people who tell me oh man You shouldn't be kind of like signaling like that. It's it. You know it makes a theorem look weak I don't give a fuck if a theorem looks weak from what I say from what anyone else says We're all about making a theorem stronger right excuse my language, but I get pretty passionate about this We're all about making a theorem a stronger network and stronger ecosystem You don't do that by burying that your head in the sand, but you have bitcoin as the classic example here I would consider bitcoin a failed experiment at this stage They have buried their head in the sand for so long right so so long that You even say like the the people who were some of the most hard-core bitcoin maximalists now having a crisis in confidence in that one Of thinking and being like oh, or maybe these people are crazy. Maybe I was part of a cult right like it gets to that point I don't want to see him to get to that point I don't think it is even close to that point But if we keep burying our head in the sand or if we start to bury our head in the sand We're going to get to that point I'm gonna I'm gonna help stop ranting on that point there because a few other things I want to get through, but I feel very very passionately about this, and I hope that you guys do as well And there was also something here from a Twitter account tux here who said since when did any of the anti crypto people ever actually give A fuck about money laundering before crypto was a thing the vast overwhelming amount of money laundering is done by banks besides tornado cash isn't even Good at money laundering instead of having any redeeming political values anti crypto people will just entirely throughout decades of electronic civil rights activism Because they hate a digital ledger so much some of y'all truly have the dumbest the most short sighted minds I've ever witnessed. This is an extremely good point because of the fact is Anticrypto people or crypto haters hate like encouraging censorship is just like I mean I'm not surprised by it But it's just insane to me because they wouldn't be encouraging it if it was done Any in any other way right just because it's crypto apparently it's fair game Which I think is just insane, but I just wanted to kind of highlight that because again That's another thing that we're fighting. We're not only fighting within crypto We're fighting the anti crypto people as well Which sucks because these people actually write letters and kind of like have fun the ears of politicians And they really are trying to get crypto either Nuded in terms of like really coming down with regulations with sanctions things like that or just outright banned right and and if you don't believe Me go listen to a podcast that bankless did with Matthew Green Where at the start of the podcast they discussed this letter that anti crypto people sent to Congress basically saying that crypto I mean, I don't think they explicitly said the crypto should be banned, but they painted crypto in the worst light possible They basically focused on all the scams and focused on none of the good stuff as a case for them to For the government to crack down on crypto, so we're fighting on that front as well But we do have some people in our corner such as the electronic frontier foundation who finally put out a statement today about the tornado Cash stuff by saying the EFF is deeply concerned the US Treasury Department has included an open source computer project tornado cash on its list Of sanctioned individuals tornado cash is an open source software project and website that published a decentralized cryptocurrency mixer code has long been recognized as speech So there are clear First Amendment implications whenever the government inhibits the publication of computer code in on public on a public website So I'm glad the EFF is standing up for us here because they have the ear of politicians and regulators for sure and they're distinctly outside I guess like the crypto ecosystem they fight for all I guess some computer all kind of like rights when it comes to technology So very very good to to see that there and last up here We have julio from the Aragon foundation sharing this PR on the builder spec here So apparently this PR is if we manage to deprecate the build the spec we prevent flashbots to interact with consensus layers Clients that's nullifying their OFAC compliant code post merge. Hopefully ES also the EF also stops spent sending them money I think this is a good signal to send to flashbots about MEV boost integrating and OFAC kind of like compliant kind of like a code I think that's a really dumb decision for them to be doing that and as I mentioned yesterday From everything that I've seen everything that I read they're not even legally required to do that No, no one is you know, there's no legal obligation for anyone to be censoring transactions at the protocol layer But for some reason people are going above and beyond here Which is that chilling effect that I've been speaking about but you can read this PR as well for yourself and see some discussion There but I think that's going to end the I guess like discussion about the tornado cache privacy censorship stuff for today It's probably gonna keep coming up guys. I'm gonna be honest here I'm gonna try to like not talk about it for the whole episode on the refill because I know there's other things to kind of Like cover but this is extremely important and you know The daily way and what I try to kind of like put put out in in my materials and everything that I do Is got has got to do with everything that I just spoke about at the end of the day I only do this stuff because I believe so much in a theorem I believe so much in a theorems values and if and you know if I ran for 20 minutes on the refill about them then So be it right as I said this time stamps, you can skip it You can kind of like skip on to other things But yeah ending it there the next thing to talk about is merge related stuff. So you can see here that Marius's last PR or pull request finally enables the merge on the etherium mainnet So this is obviously setting the mainnet TTD are for the merge and this was kind of like merged into kind of like the ethereum master here into into get so you can see here the lines of code that were changed and Everything that goes into that but yeah, I mean TDD is set. It's concrete I think we're just gonna have like the formal concrete. This is the you know, the TTD This is the when the merge is happening on the all core devs call this week But for all intents and purposes it is going to happen on September 15th or even earlier and Mario shared a tweet here saying that he ran some computation to confirm the TTD for mainnet the Projected date right now for TTD is the 14th of September just at 1157 Sorry 1057 p.m. To 2 a.m. Central Eastern Standard Time. I think this is central central or Central European Standard Time. I think that is So yeah, I mean it's either gonna happen 14 15 or 16 depending on timezone But as I said, this can also be affected by hash power changes and things like that So we don't know and you know until closer to the merge But I do think there's gonna be a large number of miners who are just gonna mine to the last block It doesn't really make sense for them to not do that Because they're still each being paid out There's still rewards being paid out and they can inch out every last drop until the merge happens and obviously there's those proof-of-work chains that are that are going to Kind of continue on and try to I guess like get some fanfare around them But as I've said before I pretty much think those are all scams I don't think there anything worth paying attention to but miners might you know, just automatically switch over to that They may switch to a theorem classic but you know These kind of like other coins don't have the market caps don't have the value to support the amount of miners that a theorem has So in reality mine a lot of them are just gonna shut down their machines whatever GPUs they're gonna have They're gonna just sell there's gonna be a massive influx of GPUs If you're a gamer looking to upgrade your GPU well There's gonna be a ton of you know mining GPUs hitting the market and the thing is is that you may think they've been damaged By being used in mining. That's actually not true. They're actually Under clocked or run are kind of like not at their full capacity because that's actually more efficient for mining So they're actually fine and you can still kind of like buy them and and be cool with them. But you know, it's funny I've been actually monitoring GPU prices over the last I guess like year or so I think at one point in Australian dollars a 3080 TI was $3,600 at the probably I think that that was like the peak of the bull market where obviously there was a lot of demand from for Mining and now in Australian dollars again, it's $1,500 So that's a massive reduction and I think it's gonna go even even below that probably below $1,000 and Nvidia is bringing out there a new 4000 series GPU soon, so that's gonna kind of like hit the the 3000 series as well So I really do think you can probably pick up a 3080 TR a 30 90 TR for under a thousand bucks and that's new And we're talking about secondhand. You can probably get one much cheaper than that I'm hooking in Australian dollars, of course for those of you who just want to reference here I think the last time I checked the Australian dollar was like 65 to 70 cents to a US dollar there So whatever that converts out for you, I mean 700 US dollars would be a thousand dollars roughly it's like not exactly that but just to give you some context Don't know what the European conversion is right now I think it's about the same actually last time I checked as the US dollar conversion But yeah, my point is is that like GPUs are gonna be very cheap So if you're a gamer looking for a cheap GPU You just have to wait another month until the merge hits and then there's probably gonna see like an influx there and the prices will Definitely collapse I think alright, so Apparently Argentina Argentina's capital bonus ed is is going to be running a theorem nodes in 2023. This is pretty cool I actually love it when I guess nation states are friendly with crypto, right? And I think there's nothing more friendly than running a theorem nodes I guess maybe the next thing more friendly would be running if you're invalidate is right and not engaging in censorship, right? Just running in a theory invalidate as you normally would But yeah I think this is kind of like obvious next step for maybe a smaller nations and smaller kind of like nation states around the globe To embrace crypto. I really do think that we're gonna have over the next few decades We're gonna have a very funny kind of like thing playing out where there's gonna be You know some probably smaller nation states smaller nations I'm talking smaller in terms of GDP probably not population but like smaller in terms of of GDP embracing crypto right embracing kind of like Ethereum embracing these neutral technologies and they're gonna probably see some of them that don't I mean you can probably already guarantee that China's not Gonna embrace anything open But the u.s. Seems to be not going in the right direction right now, but maybe they end up changing course Maybe they do go in the right direction because right now as I said like with the tornado cache stuff they're definitely firmly not going in the right direction and it was proven in a court of law that That what they did with the tornado cache sanctions was actually unconstitutional And potentially even illegal and that's a huge blow to them and a huge boon for us But as I've said that's gonna take a while to play out but good to see these smaller nations here are such as Argentina within within borders it but as it is are running a theorem nodes and kind of like signaling that they support a theorem Are from I guess like not just this kind of technical layer But also the social layer because for them to say hey We're gonna run a theory of nodes is a social signal to the world saying that we think this thing is Worth kind of paying attention to which I think is really really cool All right So on September 7th There'll be good coin grants around 15 kicking off and this will be the biggest funding and building event in web 3 and it will Run till September 22nd So mark your calendars for that There's also this thread here from get coin going through all you need to know when it comes to get coin grants around 15 which you can kind of a read about here. I'll link this in the YouTube description Below so I guess like the TLDR here is that there will be a main round Multiple cause rounds and multiple ecosystem rounds are the main round is the longest-standing get coin grants in support of web 3 open source software Approved projects are open source and public goods and don't have a VC funding over 500,000 So this is like the criteria here VC funding over $500,000 don't have tokens don't have NFTs to sells and don't have promos for tokens NFTs in the grants which which I think is really cool get coin has historically suffered from this where some projects Will issue a token and then still have a good coin grant or they'll have VC funding or they you know They're kind of like have some form of funding where they actually don't need the grant and that takes away money from what takes away Matching from the people who actually do need the money So that's always been a bit of an issue for get coin But I think they've been working on it and I think they get they're getting to a place where it's it's actually not You know a huge issue anymore. But yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to this round It's in what ah, you know the cool thing about this round as I think I mentioned this last time It's running through the merge the main net merge transition, which is cool But yeah, I guess like less than a month away about three weeks away from now until this starts But I'll keep you guys updated on on that as it gets closer All right. So ZK sync have put out a thread yesterday It was saying 74 days to ZK sync 2.0 on mainnet with the dream of a ZK ZKVM solution for the ethereum community becoming a reality We've seen a wave of projects launching on ZK sync 2.0 every Monday will be highlighting some of the members of our growing ecosystem So I guess like every Monday from now on that we went at one of these threads So this is the first thread here going over I kind of like the protocols that will be launching on a ZK sync 2.0 I noticed the protocols but like middleware and things like that and infrastructure So if you want to know what's going to be live on ZK sync 2.0 You can go read this thread and then follow their account for threads every Monday leading up to the launch in 74 days there All right. Finally here We have a Galleon that has introduced Galleon portfolios a low-cost way to gain simple exposure to the most popular crypto investing themes Updated and rebalanced frequently so you can read this full release article below and also dive into the four launch portfolios in this thread So these are being built on token sets, of course on set protocol So there is one called merge Which is this portfolio allows holders to capture the performance related to the highly anticipated merge event on aetherium Moving the network to proof of stake we provide exposure through staing providers and defy which you can check out here SPI which is a synthetic ecosystem index fees Which allows holders to invest in the top five protocols and networks generating organic consistent fees to the project stakeholders in some capacity this is based on main net and plan to release other network variants soon and votes which the VE token index allows holders to track the rise of vote escrow tokens often influence the direction of Emissions within defy these tokens are appealing to other dows as they help facilitate their own protocol or growth. This is really cool I like this. I mean there hasn't really been anything like this. I believe in the past So it's cool to see that you can now I guess again exposure to popular groups They're investing themes as they say here and now I guess like narratives that we call them And yeah, I mean you can check out the blog post for full details on everything such as allocations And where you can buy and things like that? I will disclose here that I'm investor in galleon and I'm also an advisor to set so a bit of a conflict of interest Yeah, but I mean, I think these are really really cool I think that what they're building is very cool, and I'm still very bullish on index kind of like Index systems or index tokens especially as we on board more and more of the Traditional finance ecosystem and more and more of the regular user who doesn't want to have to sift through a million different tokens They just want something that they can get nice passive exposure to and hopefully get some growth over time with that as well So check this out only get a new to description below. I think that's gonna be it for today So thank everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet Give me a thumbs up subscribe to newsletter join the disco channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone

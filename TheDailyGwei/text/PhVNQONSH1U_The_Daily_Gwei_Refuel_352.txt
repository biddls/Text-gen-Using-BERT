 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the dailygue refuel where we cap the latest news near theorem ecosystem I'm your host tientes asano and today's the 12th of april 2022 All right, everyone and let's get into it. So a lot of merge updates, uh today of the last 24 hours. I covered the merge Uh for you know a fair bit of yesterday's episode and i'll be doing the same today Things are really heating up here guys Like it may feel like the merge is quote unquote taking forever maybe because I talk about it like all the time And you probably hear about it from other sources Uh, but you know, it hasn't actually been that long since we've been doing these kind of like test this testing and kind of These test nets and dev nets and things like that Um, but uh, yeah in the kind of like latest round of things is what I kind of talked about yesterday and touched on yesterday With this main net shadow fork that they were doing. So this was a success the blocks finalizing Everything looks solid on the execution clients. Uh, and as tarant says here congrats to all the hard-working teams. So Uh, I think marius had a tweet as well about this where he said, you know, it was a huge success, but Uh nethermine and basu two of the execution layer clients stopped at the transition But affix is being deployed to nethermind that allows them to sync up and geth and aragon are processing happily and geth and aragon Account for over 80 of the execution layer clients So, you know if this was to happen on main net it would be fine Because our client diversity on the execution layer isn't as good as we need it to be and this is probably a time where? Non-client diversity is a positive but not really. I mean you could make an argument either way there But essentially for all intents and purposes it was uh, it was a huge success, which is awesome to see I mean as I said, this was the first main net shadow fork and as i've described shadow forks before basically taking the I guess network A network and ethereum network as it exists at one point in time Today and it's a live network and forking that and doing the doing the kind of like merge transition through that So the fact that the first main net shadow fork actually worked with minimal issues I would call these bugs with nethermine and basu minor bugs from what i've seen And as I said because they don't account for a lot of the chain anyway Right now at least they wouldn't have stopped this transition going through if this would happen on main net It would have been would have been fine. So yeah, everything seems to be going going well and you can see here There's a block explorer. Oh, no, sorry, not a blocky store explorer Just like a dashboard where you can see everything going on on the um, the shadow shadow forked network here And you can see all the all the different kind of like um nodes and stuff like that here. So very very cool I mean, you know, I was speaking about dates yesterday as well around the main net Well around the merge and I kind of like went all over that and I said, yeah zero percent chance It's going to be in june. I mean I even saw tim biko say on twitter today that it's not happening in june So that's just not me saying it that's tim biko who obviously is very heavily involved with ethereum core development saying that as well Uh, I think this week on the core devs call on friday. There's going to be a lot of discussions around dates I think in particular they're going to discuss about the difficulty bomb because if we don't do a difficulty bomb Sorry, if we don't do the merge Uh before we kind of like delay the difficult difficulty bomb or before the difficulty bomb goes off and makes the network basically unusable We would have to do a separate hard fork to delay the difficulty bomb because with the merge the difficulty bomb is actually going away It's not going to be a thing on ethereum anymore Uh, so I think there's going to be a lot of discussion on friday around that and we may get like a launch window You know the difficulty bomb could still go off and then we could just merge like two weeks later or something like that But yeah, i'm not sure yet as I said yesterday. I could see it being pushed out to august september, you know A kind of thing, uh, but it could there's still a coin toss of it happening in july, right? It could happen at the end of july. I'm i'm not sure I think we're going to get a better idea on friday around this and it's going to be interesting to listen in to to this Core developer call but I think that the fact that the main net shadow fork went so well and it seems that Everything seems to be working, you know quite well besides these these these bugs and these other clients that we need to fix Um, we're probably going to do more of these kind of like shadow forks and see how it goes from there But given all of this, you know, I I could see them still targeting kind of like a july even august kind of um Out of timeline here, but even if it happens in august I think the difficulty bomb at that point would need to be delayed another hard fork depending on when it happens in august because for Those who don't know the difficulty bomb basically basically increases the difficulty on a kind of like um Curve that grows exponentially over time which makes the block times a lot longer So essentially what would happen is we would end up eventually with like 30 40 50 second minute minute Minute blocks, right and that's that's obviously unworkable for ethereum like imagine ethereum having a one minute block It'd be waiting at least one minute for your transactions to happen all the defi stuff happening all the arbitrage stuff happening on chain The prices move a lot, you know within a minute. It just it would be unworkable It'd be it'd be really really slow and it'd suck right? It'd be it'd be really bad So the difficulty bomb would have to be delayed from there and who knows how long the delay would be Maybe it's just a three month delay from there because they're confident they can get the merge in within that time frame But as I said timing wise we'll just look and see what happens on the core dev call on friday Which I probably won't be able to cover on the refill because of my traveling plans But i'm sure you all see it on twitter anyway and see what comes out of that uh, and and things like that there and there was another tweet here from uh from from marius that uh, Basically highlighted that the mainnet shadow fork actually found an issue that they the core developers could have easily missed on the devnet And the issue was that the default gas limit is set to eight million But mine is voted up to 30 million right on main main that it's 30 million Since most validators would run with the default value the gas limit would quickly drop. So essentially, uh, if for example we did the merge and then the um, uh The kind of like, uh, the the validator is running the default kind of like um values at eight million We'd have a massive drop in the gas limit, which means that probably I mean the block space would get It would get like this it would get kind of like cut in two-thirds or less than that Um, and the fees would probably like skyrocket There'd be a bit of pen pandemonium on chain and then all the validators would have to vote it back up or change their values To 30 million again. So the default gas limit is now changed to 30 million But yeah, this kind of stuff is easily missed on the devnet so very very cool that this was caught in the shadow fork This isn't something that would prevent the merge from happening, but it would be kind of like Something that would happen like immediately post merge where the gas limit which is essentially ethereum's block size Would go down a lot and people would be like why did this happen? Uh, and you know for I guess for like a little bit of time people would be Would be kind of like concerned and be like, you know, why did this happen? Like what's going on? You know, this is really bad and they might not even pick up on something like this, right? And that's what these the shadow forks are for picking up as as I said before guys the merges is incredibly complex It is not something easy to do. That's why there's so much testing being done That's why there's so many different types of testing being done because we need to be able to catch as many as much as possible Right, and I'd actually be concerned if there weren't issues being caught because it would kind of like mean are we missing something? Like I remember feeling this when I believe the final test net that was done before the beacon chain was launched Uh went out went off without a hitch. There was no issues and I was like, uh, I don't actually like that You know, I feel better when there's issues being found because if there's no issues well There's never no issues like honestly in software development The one thing I've learned especially within within crypto is that there are always issues big or small There is always going to be a bug that you will find at one point or another and if you don't find anything Well, that's concerning right? So so yeah, that's kind of like something that they were able to catch with the main net shadow fork And then if you're on arm also tweeted out there running their kill node on a Raspberry Pi 4 using only the micro SDS storage Which is really really cool. So I like these sorts of things. I like being able to run Ethereum kind of like software on Limited hardware like a Raspberry Pi 4 instead of like a beefy machine or anything like that because you don't need that I mean the whole Point of a theory I mean the whole point of the fact that it layer one is going to remain No, relatively unscalable for for end users is is because of the fact that we want to keep it You know easy to run right easy to sync up a node easy for everyone to kind of like Have a history of the chain if they wanted to so cool to see this from a theorem on arm here But I think that's all the merge updates for now As I said Friday's core dev call is gonna be a big one that's gonna be very important to pay attention to I'm pretty sure I'm going to be on a plane during that core dev call which sucks because I'm gonna have to wait until I get off the Plane and be able to check Twitter and kind of like see what's going on there But I mean, it's not gonna be anything kind of like, you know to FOMO over It's it's probably just gonna be a you know I kind of like another target window given or so or something like that or maybe there's a decision made that the difficulty bomb needs To be delayed because the merge is probably not gonna happen You know before it starts affecting the network negatively who knows right like I am not going to sit here and say that I can give An accurate kind of like estimate or accurate measure of what's what's gonna happen here But as I said like currently with the information I have available to me July is a coin toss so 5050 and whatever happens in July and I would say that's that's end of July if it happened in July But it's looking more likely to be all this of September or September. You know if it gets pushed out of September You know if it gets pushed out of September whatever I mean at the end of the day guys like it's like three more months Wait, I just don't get why people are so concerned about this It's not like the eighth price is gonna 10x immediately after the merge like that's just not gonna happen Right and the longer that it kind of like takes to happen the longer that takes the information to disseminate out there the cheaper If you get that's the way I think about it because it's gonna happen It's just you know, if it happens like in June July August September, it doesn't really matter it's not that much of a of a kind of like I know III shy away from calling it a Delay because it's not a delay, but it's not that much of a difference right so say something to keep in mind I mean, I'm I always hop on about this I know some people find that annoying, but that's just the way I view things so so yeah All right, so a bit of news from the signing signing with aetherium world today So signing in with aetherium wallets is now available as as an option for all all zero clients So spruce ideas worked with all zero lab to make this work. So this is basically Using your theory and wallet as you normally would you know sign in with aetherium as I've described before To sign in with the with the all zero Platform here so you can see there's a blog post here of What's going on with all of this and explaining how this all works? It's quite lengthy as well kind of goes through how it's actually working So you can see this flow chart here of like, you know website user Logging dot XYZ and aetherium ENS and how that all works there with verifying signatures and all that sort of stuff there and serving pages Which is very very cool And you know, this is a guide of how to add I'd sign in with aetherium to what they call your tenant which is kind of like what all zero provides here As a platform you can see it's directly integrated into their Software suite which is very very cool to see right next to things like sign in with slack, right? How cool is that? So I know the theorem is becoming a you know accepted web 2 and web 3 way to kind of like authenticate which I'm obviously super excited about But yeah, definitely check out these blog posts for more information on this. This is One of the things I'm most excited about that is a non-financial thing in aetherium people always talk about and go on about you know What a non-financial applications in aetherium that don't just exist to make people money, you know aren't just Ponzi's aren't just speculative vehicles Well, it's signing with aetherium. That's like the perfect example and an ENS is another example that I always use But signing with a theorem and ENS go hand in hand as well But the sign in with a theorem is just so powerful imagine signing in to anywhere on the web and being able to carry your profile with you because your profile is your on-chain identity and I talked yesterday about get pop and pop in general and about how they're gonna make Identity and reputation kind of like a thing or in aetherium But you know sign in with aetherium just takes that all that information that you have on your aetherium account And it lets you kind of like port that wherever you want That's going to be very very powerful for things like decentralized social media, which I'm very excited about Things like lens protocol which I've spoken about before but that's to me. I mean sign with aetherium to me along with ENS and that call family is The thing that you everyone should point to when people ask them about non speculative non money non DeFi use cases of aetherium Obviously we have the dowels and stuff like that, but a lot of the dows are attached to monetary things because they have tokens And those tokens are kind of like, you know in the Treasury and stuff like that, but sign in with aetherium You know, I don't know I'm not gonna say they're never gonna have a token because you guys know my rule is that everything has a token but regardless of Them having a token or not Signing with a theorem is just such an incredibly cool primitive that can be integrated not just in web3 but in web2 as well And that's what I'm actually most excited about the integrations with web2 Because it's like the Trojan horse of getting aetherium into the web2 world, you know I imagine all these web2 websites maybe not something like Facebook Maybe Twitter will do it but not not something not like Facebook or anything like that But imagine a lot of these web2 websites say, okay Well, I have signed in with Facebook I have signed in with none with Twitter sign with email blah blah blah Well, I'll just add sign in with aetherium to my my site and then imagine the experience That people get from being able to port things over from and put their profiles over from from place to place portal They state or they kind of like and especially their financial he's not financial history Maybe because hopefully we'll have privacy preserving stuff there But like their financial state right being able to kind of like exchange value through just signing in with aetherium on things That sort of stuff to me is super cool it that is web3 to me That is that the coolest things web3 is kind of like the shared state where you control your own data You control your own privacy eventually as well and you'd be able to kind of like port that to different websites and different services across the Across the internet. So definitely check out this this blog post more information on this, but I was excited to see this integration happen All right. So uniswap Labs has announced something today so what they've announced is Uniswap Labs ventures, which is basically the venture arm of Uniswap, so They say here at Uniswap Labs Our goal is to unlock universal ownership and exchange for everyone starting with bringing millions of people into the emerging web3 economy So what Uniswap Labs ventures will do is it will invest in teams at different stages and levels of the web3 stack from infrastructure To develop the tools and consumer facing applications We're also focused on investing in projects that are closely aligned with our values building for the long run collaborating openly with communities and putting users first So they've already invested in 11 companies and several native protocols across the web3 ecosystem So just tenderly make our are there and compound and and party down and layer zero here as well Which is really cool to see but yeah, I mean, I think this is cool I think it's cool that Uniswap is doing more with their massive Treasury that they have I know that it kind of like when you when you look at this and kind of like peel behind the curtain Some people get a bit annoyed Because the Treasury is mostly denominated in the uni token and the uni token has not performed very well against USD and against ETH Obviously, you know since the during the first airdrop like when everyone got the airdrop and if you held on to it You you did quite well, but if you bought on market, especially near the all-time high You've done quite poorly and you know If I just bring up kind of like how the uni token has performed here you you understand what I mean? It's down 80% from its all-time high against USD. It's down even more against ETH And a lot of people kind of look at that and are like, okay Well, I'm just completely wrecked on my investment And now Uniswap Labs is using their Treasury or Uniswap Labs Ventures using the Treasury in order to fund other things It's just gonna put more sell pressure on the token and all that sort of stuff But guys, I'll be honest at the end of the day. This is gonna happen regardless So for example, Uniswap has their Treasury where they have uni tokens and they'll sell those uni tokens to fund different things Is it any different than? Ethereum paying miners in ETH to secure the network to basically add value to the network To keep the network running and then they sell that ETH to the market same is gonna be true for stakers You know, don't forget stakers do get a block reward And you know and there's no cap on on a kind of like supply The reason why we're gonna be deflationary is because of the burn but that is you know orthogonal to To kind of like the other stuff happening there to the fact that we need to pay Validators and miners and all that stuff there. So there's always going to be sell pressure coming from somewhere But it's on the ecosystem to improve the token omics of the actual token I've described ETH token omics in great detail plenty of times on the refuel to me Eth has the best token omics the best value accrue out of literally any asset within crypto I don't see any other asset that has the same value accrual, you know mechanisms and and and the same Kind of like value accrual our narratives as well around it. Nothing even comes close to be honest But it doesn't mean that other things can't improve their token omics or can't come close I mean right now if you knew swap wanted to if the community came together vote on this they could implement that fee Take for uni token holders They could just switch it on zero point zero five percent of the fee would go to uni token holders If they staked their uni it would lock up a lot of uni it would get a cut cash flow going It'd be easier to evaluate it'd be more enticing to buy and the token might, you know, would probably appreciate in value But that's not happening for a myriad of different reasons. I think the biggest one is definitely regulatory reasons because the Uniswap Labs team is not You know that they do not want to attract any kind of like undue attention because they're based in the US I get that but at the same time it's kind of like shitty for the uni token holders And I totally get why people are upset. I personally don't hold any uni I pretty much I think I sold all of my airdropped uni at this point I had a bunch across a different addresses. So this isn't me being a salty bag hold or anything like that This is me sympathizing with the people that kind of like bought this and and and I get like their frustration But at the same time this is the sort of stuff that you have to take into account when buying into things You need to realize that most things are stupidly overvalued In these tokens and a lot of them don't have ways to keep that value and accrue value A lot of them has have low circulating supplies with tokens unlocking over time So you really need to look into this like I mean maybe one day I should do a crash course on what I look at when I look at kind of like tokens to invest in But I don't want to give investment advice Like I really don't want to tell someone, you know, don't buy this because of that or I would never do that But and then you know, then it goes up in value This is why I'd never really talked to especially newer people that I meet in real life about this They always ask, you know, what should I put money into and if they push me on the matter? I just say to them. Hey, like I you know, I buy eighth. Let's see. I just tell them what I buy I don't tell them why I buy it why I'm bullish on it I don't tell them, you know why why I think it's a good investment or anything like that I just say I'm involved with the theorem I buy eighth I hold eighth. That's that's what I do And I it's just I just don't want to be seen as giving kind of like investment advice here But I think that I would actually be able to do a lot of good going through the list of things I look for when looking at tokens to evaluate just just to evaluate it as you're on like you can decide whether to buy or Sell something or speculate on it, but in terms of actually what to look at. I think a lot of people are very confused I think a lot of people don't realize this especially newer people to the ecosystem and They get taken to the cleaners really at the end of the day and I've spoken about this on the refill plenty of times before But there are so many retail investors that just get psyops tricked, you know Fleeced just constantly in this industry. I see it time and time again and it just I mean, it's a bit frustrating But at times I kind of like think that people have to go through this trial by fire in order to become better investors I true I truly believe that to be honest because unless you have someone helping you like along the way that's that's very experienced So for example, like if you had me helping you and and I you know, I don't do this for anyone But if you had me like in your ear helping you telling you and giving you all my experiences over the years of being in This market you may not have to go through that trial by fire. But as I said, I'm not gonna do that Most people aren't gonna do that They don't want that responsibility They don't want that that harder at the headache of You know potentially even being wrong because the market just goes stupid for some reason But I do think like someone even just babying you along and telling you I don't I don't think that's that's worth Anywhere near as much as it's worth going through your trial by fire on your own But anyway, I've gone off on a bit of a tangent there. I think it's cool What Uniswap Labs is doing here with ventures. I think it you know, it's gonna lead to more funding of things Especially public goods within aetherium, which is very very cool So you definitely check out the blog post more information about this old and kid in the YouTube description So I'll be trim announced today that they're setting up a collab with rat well, which is a crypto artist I then they're responsible for tubby cats in FT after working about rat Well on the refill before really big fan of what they're doing of the work. They're doing I'm really a big fan of tubby cats as well. I've got an honorary tubby cat there So maybe I should just disclose that and also our project the galaxy here And what they're doing is that the collaborating on a two-month long journey to invite users to explore the defy NFT Ecosystem on Arbitrum so users who join will be able to claim up to 17 free exclusive NFTs designed by a rat Well, which is pretty enticing right? These aren't just your random entities the same design by just anyone Right well is actually a very big deal in the NFT ecosystem for those who don't know They do a lot of amazing work as I said tubby cats is one of my favorite NFT projects I know it's a preffile picture NFT project, and I've said that I'm bearish on those before But I think at least tubby cats like they're kind of like using the funds for public goods funding as well And they're also going and and the arts pretty cool as well. It's unique and they're not From I mean I mean there are some people on Twitter shilling it and stuff like that But the community is really cool like I really do like the community there And I'm not just saying that because I have an honorary one or I have you know a couple of other ones like I mean they're Inconsequential to me in terms of kind of like monetary value But I just I really do like the art at the end of the day there And I think that well has yeah, or 36,000 followers now on Twitter So definitely not a no one so you should definitely check out this if you want to get some of these exclusive NFTs this kind of goes through what to do and which teams are going to be included in the in the round So there's 56 projects included in the round which is pretty big and you know what's even bigger I didn't even realize that 56 projects on arbitrum. That's crazy like oh man I'm gonna go on a layer to rant here if I if I start if I don't stop myself I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say anything more than it's amazing those 56 projects on our which there's probably more than that This these are just what the ones that included in this initiative But you should definitely check out this blog post for more information about this and how to get involved with it I think this is a really cool way to grow adoption and grow kind of usage of arbitrum But yeah, if you want to get your hands on one of those NFTs definitely go check this out for yourself All right, connects has unveiled their latest upgrade that's coming to the network called Amarok Which so this is going to be the first network upgrade that is going to come to the connects bridge ecosystem here So what is it as connects describes it here Amarok is the first major network upgrade for connects for the past few months We've been quietly collecting data about the biggest headaches that stakeholders face when using connects the amor upgrade Re-architects our protocol to fix these headaches. So TLDR is that similar to the modular blockchain thesis? We can get the best set of trade-offs for bridges while preserving trust minimization by modularizing our architecture So you can see here what the the modularization of the architecture will will entail on this image So you have different layers like the application layer and they'll have different protocols and stakeholders attached to them So you can check this out a link. I'll link the thread and then Also, the Amarok upgrade migrates connects to using nomad to pass messages between chains This lets us get rid of the first two-phase prepare fulfill flow signing to claim funds and fund lockup issues and makes the flow Much cheaper and faster. So basically simplifying that whole flow there for using connects Which of course is very very good for the end user and also they're kind of fun doing some stuff around liquidity here and Most importantly this upgrade will enable simple chain first integrations into connects with arbitrary message passing and cross chain callbacks So this basically means asynchronous solidity Which is what they call the new paradigm and what you can build is pretty much anything and here are some examples of this And this is what excited me the most So basically you can build a decks that connects the could be across chains in a single seamless transaction Cross-chain vault zaps and vault strategy management critical protocol operations such as replicating syncing global constants across chains Bringing uni v3 t-waps to every chain without introducing oracles chain agnostic via token governance and metaverse to metaverse interoperability What I want to just deep dive into is the first kind of a point here Which is connecting decks liquidity across chains in a single seamless transaction Do you guys understand the implications of this if I'm reading this right and if I get em getting this right? Which I think I am Potentially using connects you will be able to do a cross chain Across kind of like L to exchange between our virtual optimism for example where essentially you You say on our bedroom. I want to trade 8th for usDC on optimism And you can do that all while being on our bedroom while not needing to bridge your funds directly across to optimism It just all happens in a seamless transaction. It brings it back for you. That is stupidly powerful I've talked about this before but the fact that connects is kind of making moves here with it really really bullish I'm super excited for that in terms of where this upgrade is in its lifecycle It's on a private test net Right now with key partners and community members testing it out and in the next few weeks is going to be a public test net That anyone can build on example cross-chain apps guides documents protocol specifications and more and of course audits So if you want to get involved you can join the discord channel It's linked there, but I'll link this thread in the YouTube description as well for you to check out I'm if you can't hear to my voice. I'm super excited about this upgrade I think it's going to enable a lot of really cool things especially on the in the cross cross l2 world So yeah highly recommend checking this out of reading the blog post for more information here I just wanted to hide this blog post out of the immutable X ecosystem called a guide to NFT platform security Which basically goes through the different platforms that? Kind of working on NFTs, but also working on other things and how they achieve security what their bridges look like what the consensus looks? Like you know what they are on the l2 spectrum on the sidechain spectrum all that sort of stuff And this is incredibly detailed guys. I mean you can see me scrolling through this right now It is a 14 minute read and this will give you an absolutely amazing view or not just like The NFT kind of security, but like just security in general on these l2 side chains bridges all that sort of stuff So just wanted to highlight it and say I highly recommend giving it a read Because of the fact that it just provided me a lot of value when I read through it And I think you're gonna get a lot of value out of it as well So just before I jump into something I wanted to talk about at the end and rant a little bit about just a quick shout out here my talk that I Had with Maddy at at the Sydney blockchain week events is now live on YouTube So I'll link this in the description for you to check out so people who are asking for that definitely give it a listen I I felt it was a really great talk And I I personally learned a lot with with with Maddy as well And we talked about a lot of e2 consensus layer related stuff, so definitely check this out. It'll be linked in the description below All right so the final thing I wanted to rant about here today is something that coinbase announced where they basically announced the assets under consideration That they're looking to list in q2 2022 now the reason I wanted to highlight this because I quote tweeted this and said to be Honest given how dogshit most of these assets are a lot of preferred is zero transparency around them Because the assets that they are looking to list most of them are so bloody bad that I actually can't believe they're doing this how Far coin base has fallen since their original digital asset framework that I don't know how many of you remember this framework Came out a long time ago four plus years ago That actually had a framework in place that that kind of like it was a really great framework for listing things But now it seems like they're just listing anything It doesn't even matter what it is look at some of these shit big data protocol you recall that This is one of those yield farming scam Ponzi things that attracted billions of dollars in TVL Justin some was farming and stuff like that, and then it basically went to zero some of these other shit here I mean just dope wars paper. What the hell is that right? I haven't heard of most of these sorts of things, honey I don't even know what that is You know so there's some good ones in there like index cop and stuff like that, but but look at this sort of stuff I don't get it like there was one here called student coin Pokemon. Which was an actual scam like it was It's not even a question of if it was it wasn't it was a scam and they're listing this and the worst part about it Is that most of these assets don't have any trading volume, so why are they listing them like it's not even like they're gonna Make money from it you can I'm ranting here like full-on ranting guys because I just thought that coinbase could be that beacon for this industry that legitimate beacon It wasn't gonna be like a like a by Nance or you know one of these offshore exchanges They're just listed absolute crap And and it doesn't even make sense for them to list these things because of the fact that there's hardly any trading volume on them So what are they expecting to make out of this like I don't get it Is this some kind of like weird marketing ploy where it gets everyone to talk about coinbase because they're just considering listing the the most Absolute dog shit tokens you can think of like I don't know I mean I remember ranting about them listing shiba inu and honestly that looks amazing To some of these assets right when I kind of compare it to stuff like just like student student coin What the hell is student guy? I don't even know what it is. I really don't um and as I said like that Pokemon scams I don't know. I'm ranting too much you guys you probably getting sick of my ranting already But I just wanted to kind of like highlight that I think this is absolutely stupid. I'm so disappointed in coinbase I'm usually a pretty big fan of coinbase, but I'm just so disappointed in this sort of stuff I think that there are so many other assets that they don't have that they could least that legitimate Assets and they're actually a million times better than all of this sort of stuff um But yeah, I feel like maybe they've thrown Maybe the other reason maybe they did this is they threw a bunch of shit coins in here to throw people off and to say At the legitimate coins and to stop people from kind of like trading them. I don't know. I really don't know it's bizarre It's confusing. It's just so many shit coins and not to mention the Solana shit coins at the listing too like I don't get it But anyway, they're all free to list what they want But at the end of the day I'm just you know disappointed as a as a kind of like not user because I can't actually use coinbase because I can't sell on There but as someone who's you know as obviously been a big fan of coinbase all that they've done for this ecosystem I just hate that they're going to be funneling noobs into these just absolute shit coins and sometimes just even outright scams Just doesn't really make much sense to me, but anyway.

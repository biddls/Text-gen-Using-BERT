 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily grey review where we cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host the and then he's a signer on thursday the 7th of september 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So I spoke yesterday about the participation rates around ballot tricks and it seems that Basically, it's returned to pre ballot tricks levels I mean you can see here on the beacon chain website that we've had participation rates of over 99 again here And I think the data on um, the beacon chain website is a little bit delayed here It's not totally accurate so we can cross cross reference it with the beacon scan website, which also has the participation rate Above 99 here, which is basically what it was pre bell tricks So everything seems to be back on track with the participation rate here and I explained yesterday As to why this is, you know, obviously important and why uh people kind of were focusing on this and being like well This shows that belt there was a problem with ballot tricks I like I hate when people say that because it didn't actually show that at all This doesn't show that there was a problem with the ballot tricks upgrade itself. All it showed was that people didn't upgrade their nodes In time upgrade their software in time, so they fell off the network Or they didn't configure it correctly ballot tricks itself worked just fine. I mean the people who did upgrade Uh and saw everything and it worked completely well and completely fine There was no issues with it, uh, and then the change continued on and finalized as normal So when you kind of look at that and take all that Into consideration you definitely uh get to the point where you're like, okay Well battle tricks went went forward or went, you know, very very successfully. So I covered that yesterday I'm not going to rehash it now But there is a couple other things I wanted to get through here such as these two websites So this is node watch.io which tracks the beacon node account So you can see here. The node count is 11 917. This is the total node count Uh, 69.1 percent of that is synced to the network with 30.9 percent of them not synced right now and you can see that the node count has been going up a lot over the past few days and that's obviously because of People getting ready for the merge running more nodes here. So it's very very awesome to see that. So that's the uh, The no nodes the the beacon nodes. I should say sorry and you can see here the node count by country So a breakdown obviously the us dominates but there's a lot in germany actually, uh, 17 percent So germany's coming in second there and then a full breakdown of everything you have client type distributions Network type distributions and and and other kind of information like that So this is the website that you can go to to track the beacon nodes on the network and then there's ether nodes.org which tracks the Execution layer node so I should beacon nodes is technically consensus layer nodes Um, and then ether nodes.org tracks the ethereum execution layer nodes and as you can see here we have 7414 of these now this is broken down obviously by clients as well You've got geth, eragon, beisu, nethermind and a bunch of other clients listed here The client diversity on the execution layer is not great. Like it really is, uh leaves a lot to be desired right now And geth which is the majority client has actually been going up because people who are getting their local execution layer clients ready are choosing geth over the other ones which Obviously i've said before I think i've said in the past that we don't want to push a client diversity on the execution layer till post merge But still it's not great. I mean 81 percent of people are using geth So this means if there was a critical bug in geth 81 percent of the network would be forked onto its own chain And it would mean that that chain would finalize and that would be the kind of I guess like eth chain and it would require social coordination to fix that so you definitely want to be running a Non geth execution layer client such as eragon, beisu or nethermind. I would recommend beisu or nethermind Simply because eragon is a fork of geth So you definitely want to be running something that is on a totally different code base So beisu and nethermind are the choices there. I personally run nethermind It's always been good to me, but there's nothing wrong with beisu there But this is the website that I use and everyone uses basically To track the amount of eth1 or execution layer nodes I should say that are on the network and up here You've got the merge which is a tab that says, you know, what clients are ready for the merge which aren't About almost 80 percent are ready for the merge, which is great to see Obviously the others just need to upgrade and if they don't upgrade in time They'll be kicked off the network as solo validators or as sorry. I should say validators Uh, and they'll quickly get back online because of that. But yeah, you can check out this website yourself It's also got a breakdown of like country sync status Uh os network types history and all that sort of stuff here. So, uh, definitely go uh, give these two websites Uh a check and i'll we'll link both of them in the youtube description below All right So domothy shared this document that has been floating around for a while Which is called the serenity design rationale now for those of you who don't know Serenity was the name that I guess like a lot of people referred to eth2as for a while Uh, and it basically stemmed from I think three to four years ago as you can see the first document Was put here that for the design rationale of I guess like the quote unquote eth2ff or the you know The beacon chain or the serenity and it's just gone by a bunch of different names now why i'm highlighting this design Rationale document is because if you want to know why things were done certain ways within Especially proof of stake ethereum and and beyond then this is the document to read like I always get questions from people You know, why 32 eth right? Why is it done this way? Why? Why is there no delegation of stake in protocol? You know, there's a ton of questions, you know, what was the what was the point of? going to prove a stake like what were we aiming for well, I mean there were the the five principles here which is simplicity long-term stability sufficiency defense in depth and full light client verifiability uh, and then it discusses all of that in the document as well as trade-offs and And it discusses the fork choice rules the lmd ghost fork choice rule and gaspar and all that sorts of stuff So if you want to dive deeper into the design rationale around E2 or serenity or proof of stake ethereum then this is the document for you And now of course ben edgington is also putting together his book which is an annotated book of the The serenity or eth2 proof of stake, uh effort as well, which isn't finished yet But once that's done that'll have even more information for you But this is a document that I remember reading quite a while ago. It was last changed eight months ago So it hasn't been updated recently, but I don't think it needs to because I don't think the spec has changed Uh in the last eight months, but essentially this is a document that I really enjoyed reading because it allows me to answer those questions if you'd like why 32 eth and well basically because with the Number is based on the amount of validators the network can handle right? It's not based on some just some arbitrary thing There's a lot of other other information like that in this document. So i'll link it in the youtube description below for you to check out All right, so tim biker put out just a little innocent tweet today that I wanted to kind of talk a little bit about So he said i've said uh quote unquote we might have merged by then, uh quote Twice on meetings today and it feels pretty surreal to be honest. It's happening. It does feel surreal, right? I know i've mentioned this plenty of times but it really does feel surreal how close we are and I can't even imagine how it feels For the core developers and researchers that have been working tirelessly on this for many years at this point I mean, uh tim biker especially and of course danny ryan the two lead coordinators of the whole effort generally They've been working tirelessly on on these sorts of stuff For for many for a long time now and not only that they've also worked on other things in between right? So their efforts, uh, definitely I I hope are going to get rewarded Uh, and their efforts have been what has gotten us to this point, but it's not just them It's hundreds of researchers and developers That have gotten us to this point that is only about eight days away from today So I I think it's just amazing that you know We can basically say that we might have merged by then right if we say if we're quoting a date After september 15th, we could say oh, yeah Yeah, the merge will be done by then and we can focus on this or we can do this or we can do that And i've spoken about all these other upgrades that are going to be coming to ethereum post merge uh and the reason why they haven't come yet is because we had to basically table them in in in Favor of the merge and now that the merge is done we can start working on all this other exciting stuff So i'm super excited to just like it's going to be fun. Actually, I should step back a bit It's going to be funny for me personally that once the merge is done It's not going to be something that i'm going to talk about anymore. Like obviously it being done. It's like eip1559 I used to talk about that all the time But I mean I move on to the next thing like I am someone obviously who reports on the news and educates I refer back to things sometimes But generally there'll be no reason for me to refer back to the merge anymore ethereum will be full proof of stake We'll be looking ahead to the future with upgrades like vertical trees proto dank sharding pbs All the good stuff coming and you know all the stuff that vatali has shared in his ethereum roadmap flow chart before And there'll be no need for me to talk too much about the merge. So it's a bit bittersweet for me I've loved following the entire development. I've loved following the whole thing I loved reporting on it. I love sharing all the information with you guys But I am as ready as anyone for this thing to just happen and for us to move on to the next things in ethereum and also i'm just excited to see how The full ethereum network fares as a proof of stake network because we've seen the beacon chain on its own We've seen ethereum under proof of work on its own you're separate to the beacon chain and now we'll get to see how it all Plays out and you know who was right and who was wrong about? Certain things like there are a lot of people who are bad at this Who was right and who was wrong about uh certain things like there are a lot of people who are bearish on proof of stake Right proof of stake ethereum saying this attack vector exists or this one exists and you know You're handing over your chain to the bankers and just you know random fad random talking points But we're going to see what's actually true and what's not you know There was a one of my one of my friends said this the other day and really struck a chord with me. He goes Saying things, you know, whether it's online or otherwise that don't match with reality is free like there is no True as there is no force kind of at play that for that forces these things to match with reality But at the end of the day reality is reality like you can say whatever you want But then reality comes crashing down whether you like it or not So people can say whatever they want about ethereum proof of stake They can say it's going to be captured by this and this it's going to centralize blah blah But if that doesn't play out right as they've said well Then they are objectively wrong and reality has trumped what they've said because anyone can say anything And and reality is reality now. I know that may seem obvious to to state But I think in an industry like crypto and especially within ethereum where we see people just say the darnest of things Don't dandas dandas. I think that's that's how you say that word. I'm I don't have a Thick country American accent. Is it called country in American? I was gonna say outback. That's what we call the country in Australia I should maybe say a thick rule out outback American accent where I go darn this time, right? That was so bad Anyway, I'm getting so off track. Um, where was I actually I was talking about how the merge And how sorry how people will find things and not actually stick with reality When reality will come crashing down on them regardless of what they say so at the end of the day I personally don't care too much about what people say I do try to debunk fad here and there But if it's actual fight if it's something that doesn't match with reality then reality itself will take care of it But yeah, just a cool little tweet from Tim biker here today All right, so the new home of the heart merge nft exhibition that i've been talking about lately is going live on monday And all proceeds of course are going to the protocol guild and artists So there are 119 ethereum core devs that are going to be getting a share of these proceeds There are 16 artists eight auctions six editions and one merge exhibition so if you want to follow Stateful works and jpeg here for updates and also trent This will be going live on monday september 12th and you can participate in it if you'd like and i'll link this in the youtube Description so you can go follow all of these accounts So we have the latest allocation update from the ef ecosystem support program covering projects that received funding in q1 And q2 of 2022 so in the first half of 2022 The ef esp organized an academic grants round alongside their usual grants program awarding over 17.6 million dollars in to grantees including all of these great teams that are listed here as part of different categories So there's a category for community and education. There's a category for consensus layer cryptography and zero knowledge proofs execution layer General research indirect funding layer twos and user experience in the q1 Where a total of 9.3 million dollars was awarded and then q2 A total of an 8.2 million dollars was awarded now you can go check out the Blog post for yourself to check out everyone that received money But you know, this is this is kind of where the efs money is going now for those of you who don't know the ethereum Foundation was initially funded from the eth ico They started out with about 12 million eeth or I think exactly 12 million eeth But that has been whittled down to I think 300 250 000 eeth now because they've had to sell it to develop ethereum Obviously and obviously the price of eeth until you know mid 2017 it was Until you know mid 2017. It was it wasn't worth that much right and they had to sell a lot in the early days to fund Early ethereum so they they are very well capitalized right now. I believe they have a massive cash position and uh, you know A billion dollars worth of eath or something like that at one point and it's probably less now obviously because the price has gone down But that's where this money goes like I mean, this is one of the places it goes it goes to the support programs It goes to the ethereum foundation payroll Obviously for people to work for the ethereum foundation and a bunch of other causes like ecoin grants and things like that So if you want to dive deeper into the programs that the ef esp supports or teams I should say that the ef esp supports you should definitely go check this out. I'll link it in the youtube description below All right So finally here on the ethereum core protocol side of things franky has highlighted this very underrated paper on ethereum data structures Which you can check out here now. This is one for the technical people for the researchers This is apparently a lot more accessible than the yellow paper Which is the technical specification of the ethereum protocol itself and with a lot less details left as an exercise to the reader So just wanted to highlight this for you guys out there who want to dive even deeper into the technical Weeds of ethereum if you've read the yellow paper, then this is definitely something that would interest you I'll link it in the youtube description below for you to check out I'm, not even going to bother trying to summarize this because it is way beyond my art kind of like technical understanding But it's still very interesting nonetheless All right, so another massive raise today, uh from I guess, uh the layer 2 world so fuel labs Who are the creators of the fuel? Uh, vm announced a 80 million dollar round led by blockchain capital and stratus here So their fuel is calling themselves the fastest modular execution layer delivering the highest flexible throughput with maximum security guarantees for the ethereum Ecosystem now, of course, everyone says that right about their layer twos, but um, you know That's that's kind of like the marketing at the end of the day But anyway, it's cool to see them raise this amount of money because this is this is a huge raise. I believe One of if not the biggest layer two raises out there and I don't think fuel is limiting themselves to just ethereum they're also going to be building on celestia because some of the The founders or at least core team members share are shared between celestia and fuel Um, but regardless of that, I think that this huge fun race here is going to give them so much Runway, so many resources to just go full blast on their layer 2 effort here on their kind of like modular Modular execution layer effort here. I don't think they've actually have they said anything like l2 here at all It seems that they've said l1 l1 Uh, yeah, they're kind of like not I guess like not really using l2. Yeah Yeah, they're kind of like using l2 but this they're they're more in line with using this terminology which is the modular execution layer, which I think is I think it's okay from a branding perspective because you can see here the consensus and data layer falls at the the the bottom And then there's a modular execution layer and smart contracts that sit on top of that. So yeah Anyway, uh, you can go check out the blog post for a little bit of a deeper dive here But congrats to fuel labs on this massive raise. I am pretty excited to see that More and more layer 2 teams are raising massive amounts of money because there are still new layer ones out there that are raising huge amounts of money, which I think is Like I think it's very short-sighted by the people that are funding these things but at the same time Look, there's there's probably going to be some new Narrative next bull market shield by these like alternative layer ones that for some reason pumps the token and then the investors can cash out Whatever, but I've said before that I think most of the time Most people in this industry are behind the bleeding edge by about six to twelve months and fundraising is is no No stranger to that and is no exception to that I should say so I expect more and more layer two teams to be getting More funding I expect more and more kind of I guess like modular I guess teams getting more funding teams that are focused on the modularity of blockchains And that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone given that we I guess are over six months into the modular thing becoming very popular I think so very very cool to see this congrats to fuel labs on the rays Alright, so metamask has announced today that they've launched support for multiple languages on the metamask knowledge base So this is uh, the the knowledge about base has been translated into the top 35 most used and most Most used oh, sorry So I should say they've translated the top 35 most used and most important articles into the following 15 languages Spanish, Filipino, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Malay, Turkish, Thai, French, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, German, Korean, Italian, Dutch and Russian So a wide breadth of languages covered there, but I talked I spoke about this the other day and I said that we need more and more Things in crypto to be translated from English into other languages and what better than metamask support articles in the top 35 Most used and most important ones because obviously metamask has an absolutely massive user base and it's not just English speakers It is speakers of multiple different languages. So it's great to see them prioritizing internet into intern Internationalization here. I don't know what's wrong with my pronunciation today. It's even worse than usual, but Go check this out. If you speak any of those languages Obviously you speak English or you wouldn't be listening to me, but maybe it's not your first language Maybe you prefer to read things in Spanish or Portuguese or Japanese or German or whatever other language is supported here So I'll look this in the YouTube description for you to go check out So Arboretum has announced the first their first ever Arboretum hackathon Which is happening on October 15th and 16th in Bogota, Colombia where obviously DevCon is happening So you can go check out and apply to hack below at this this link here But I don't think Arboretum is going to be the only one doing this There are definitely going to be a lot of teams taking advantage of the fact that DevCon in Bogota is the first DevCon in like three years It is gonna be absolutely massive. Unfortunately, I will not be there. I'll be just kind of like sitting in my study Watching all the videos watching all the other things going on on social media But I think this one's gonna be big I regret that I'm not going to be there because as I said, it's the first DevCon in three years There's going to be pretty much anyone who's anyone in the ethereum community is going to be there and it's gonna be a great Celebration because it's gonna be about a month or less than a month after the merge happens as well So if you're gonna be there and if you're a developer that wants to be part of the Albatrom DevCon hackathon then I'll link this in the description below for you to apply to now as I said Albatrom isn't going to be the only one doing this So keep an eye out for any of your other favorite teams or platforms doing hackathons I'll highlight them as I see them on the refill as well But yeah, I mean at the end of the day DevCon is a developer conference It is definitely I mean it is a developer conference But at the same time most people go to conferences to socialize and you can still do that But if you are a developer or you're aspiring to be one You should definitely take advantage of all of these opportunities that will be available to you at DevCon If you've been able to get a ticket Even if you haven't like the thing with these conferences is that there's always like side conferences and there's always people there's always events happening outside the conferences that you can go to So you can go do that even if you weren't able to secure a ticket to DevCon itself Plenty of people do that, especially if you live in the region I mean if you live in South America then getting to Bogota will be relatively easy for you Even if you live in North America, it's easy I mean I guess like the hardest places to get or at least the longest flights are from from From Europe and where I am in Australia, of course, I'm from Asia But if you are in the the Americas and you haven't got a DevCon ticket, then you can still go, right? You can still go and still go to those little side events and stuff like that. So definitely go do that But as I said, I'll link this in the YouTube description if you want to apply to Arbitrums hackathon All right. So an interesting proposal here in the maker Dow world So hex and all shared here that coin base has put out a proposal to invest 1.6 billion out of the 1.6 billion dollars out Of the PSN which is the peg stability module into a yield bearing account This will boost maker revenue by 24 million a yacht maker has 5.5 billion in USD light collateral This is one of the many proposals to generate We old from the real world and he also has a follow-up tweet here about how exactly this will work and he says, you know Here's a thread to clarify some misunderstandings about this yield offering First the difference between protocol controlled value and users assets the proposal will invest in the PCV in the US DC PSM Not you at your user funds. So that's a good clarification there and then there's a bunch of others in this thread I'm not gonna read them all out. You can go check that out now I wanted to just have a broader discussion about maker Dow here on the on the heels of this proposal So I'm not gonna talk about this proposal Generally, I'm going to talk about more of maker Dow's direction and strategy Obviously, there's been a lot of drama in the maker Dow world lately They've gone from ideas around, you know yellowing in the PSM into eighth to get off reliance on centralized stable coins like USDC as well as discussions being floated that That that die should be pegged from USD because it's a risk and a bunch of other drama Of course and the usual maker drama around low governance turnout and all that sorts of stuff My honest opinion here is that I personally don't like the direction that maker is going in Because of the fact that like it really seems very confused as a project right now like before especially on the single collateral die It had a very clear mandate that everyone could understand there was die, which is it's a centralized stable coin There was eighth that could be used to generate it And you know, then you could go use that within DeFi and whatever else now in multi collateral die which I have supported in the past don't get me wrong, but now on the multi collateral die There is this kind of very weird amalgamation of things happening and it seems that the maker community wants to prioritize Real world assets or RWAs as a way to scale maker and a way to scale die And that's totally fine because as I've mentioned before the there is a there's kind of like a bottleneck when creating a decentralized stable coin and The the holy trinity of a stable coin design is having something that is scalable stable and decentralized Nothing has got those three properties at this point in time because if you're stable right and you're and you're scalable You're not decentralized or I mean it doesn't there's not like a one-to-one mapping there But you know from what I've seen from every stable coin They usually have a trade-off like the decentralized stable coins there may be stable and scalable, but they're not decentralized Right die for example under single collateral Single collateral die it was decentralized because it was only backed by ETH But it was not scalable and it wasn't very stable, right? So there are all these trade-offs and obviously we've had many many attempts at building a decentralized stable coin before But I don't really think that makers attempt here is the one that is going to I guess win Because like die is already backed by a lot of USDC if they keep backing it with real-world assets And it's just gonna be even more centralized if they keep kind of having this Like I guess like breakaway of the cohesion within the community around what direction maker should go and around Things like oh if die should actually be pegged to USD and all the other drama around that It kind of feels like they're gonna lose and they're already lost to centralized stable coins But I guess that's not an apples to apples comparison So maybe it's not right to say they lost to it But at the same time if die is back to you know, mostly by centralized assets Then why would you use die instead of just USDC or USD T right or be USD or any other centralized stable coin? But in saying that there are other attempts at building kind of stable coins that aren't pegged to the USD such as rye But that also suffers from the fact that it's truly decentralized. It's it's stable to itself. So it kind of like Flips this ability point on its head But it's not very scalable because of the fact that it is trying to be truly decentralized with just being ETH backed So there are so many trade-offs here and I actually as more time goes on I actually don't think we're going to be able to get a fully decentralized stable coin and what I mean by that is I don't think we're gonna be able to get a fully decentralized stable coin like single collateral die that is both scalable and stable we're gonna have to just Accept the fact that there requires centralization vectors in these stable coins if we want to grow them to the world Maybe I'm wrong about this but I don't think I am because I've described discusses before on the refuel unless eighth was able to obtain an Astronomical market cap. We wouldn't be able to scale a stable call Sorry scale a stable coin To where we needed it to be to service the world and I've discussed the numbers before I even went up to it like an Eth at a hundred trillion dollar market cap and I've even said how even if 10% of eighth was backing diet that market cap It still wouldn't be enough for the planet It would require eighth to be worth a stupid amount and at that point you would just use eighth as your currency, right? You wouldn't even bother using a stable coin that was pegged to the US dollar So it's kind of a thing of if eats market cap goes to a stupid high level Then eighth would probably just be the unit of account and the moa that we use within the world Anyway, I know that sounds very far-fetched, but that is more likely a scenario Then something utilizing ether's collateral to create a stable coin peg to the USD Which if all intents and purposes at that point if eighth achieved a hundred trillion dollar market cap Then I don't think the USD would be worth very much because obviously that is measured in USD there and then you can go dive Even deeper into things like measuring purchasing power measuring stability of assets against itself Like it it's always funny when you think about the stability of assets if you measure USD stability against energy prices For example, I mean USD hasn't been very stable against energy prices at all It's lost value against energy prices and just general purchasing power It's lost a lot of value because of inflation both monetary and supply side And I don't think that's something that people think about too often and maybe I'm going off a little bit of a tangent here But people tend to think of stability as USD But in reality if you had held USD over the last five years, right you have lost so much purchasing power and the thing is is that depending on your time frame and depending on your Your way of viewing things it's very hard to see what you've lost and what you haven't because one USD equals one USD Yes, but one eighth equals one eighth as well So if you're just comparing USD to itself and saying all USD stable because it won you a steak was one USD Well, you can say the same thing for eight but because you're measuring East value against the US dollar That's where the volatility comes from Imagine if we had measured USD against the purchasing power or against energy bills if you have that chart We have those shots We see the energy prices going up right that that is the true measure of USD stability if you want to think about it Like that so in my mind either way I look at stability is purchasing power. So I Yeah, I don't really think we're gonna get a truly decentralized USD stable coin that is scalable and stable because at that point Or stable to its stable relative to other things because at that point Either we just be big enough to act as that currency and MOE and and eighth will be that very good store of value as well So yeah anyway That's a I can I could talk about that for a long time because this is something that I think about very very deeply as Someone who is in a position that tries to preserve capital now I'm less about growing capital like in an exponential way more about preserving what I already have I'm always thinking about purchasing power for me. It's always like okay I don't want to hold too much fear because of such-and-such, you know Because of inflation because of this because of that but I also don't want to leave myself in a position where I'm just exposed to risk Assets, so I try to diversify I try to do things here. It is very difficult, right but it's something that I think about often as a thought exercise to and something that you met maybe maybe you'll get value of thinking About as well was measuring things as part of like purchasing power rather than measuring everything against the you know A fiat such as USD, but I'm gonna leave that at that for today. I think that's all I wanted to talk about So yeah, thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel If you haven't yet give a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the disco channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone

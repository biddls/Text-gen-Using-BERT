 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Daily Quay Refuel where we cap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host Anthony Sassano and today's the 18th of January 2022. Alright everyone let's get into it. So today Evan Van Ness and Josh Stark published their year in Ethereum 2021 review blog post. Now this is quite a lengthy read here it goes through everything that happened with Ethereum in 2021 from DeFi to NFTs to protocol upgrades like EIP-1559 and all that good stuff there. Now obviously I highly recommend going and giving this a read if you haven't yet. I read it earlier today and honestly as I kept reading I just kept getting more and more excited. Like it's always well and good to kind of talk about what's happening on from day to day as I do on the on the refuel but then kind of like doing a retrospective and looking back at what happened in 2021 and kind of like going through all the metrics and seeing how much success Ethereum had in 2021 just got me super pumped up. And then you know towards the end you kind of like have things about like you know what what's happening this year going forward stuff like the merge layer twos and I just and I just came away after reading all of this just like super pumped for you know the past present and future of Ethereum really at the end of the day. So I highly recommend giving this a read but I did want to talk about a couple of things here. I think what stood out to me the most just scrolling through here was things like total transaction fees. Now I know layer one fees are high and it's kind of like funny how it's the thing that Ethereum is most criticized for but it's also the thing that I think is most bullish when it comes to Ethereum is the fact that last year in 2021 people paid a total of 10 billion dollars in transaction fees in 2021 to use the Ethereum network. Now I'm pretty sure this kind of like most of this kind of I guess happened towards maybe the the end of the year or kind of like the last six months of the the first six months were high but not as high as this and then you can kind of see here that how it compares to Bitcoin. Bitcoin only did a billion dollars so Ethereum did 10 times the amount of fear of when US Bitcoin did but and if you kind of like take those a dollar terms Ethereum's market cap sorry each market cap is is you know I guess less than half of Bitcoin and then kind of like if you kind of like extrapolate that out and kind of do that overall of 2021 it becomes even more pronounced and the reason why I bring up market cap is because you're measuring this as ETH USD value and BTC USD value so obviously BTC's USD value is higher so the fact that if Ethereum is kind of like 10 times greater even though it's might you know it has a much less not much less market but less than 50 percent of the market power Bitcoin is a pretty big deal there so there's that and then there's another chart here of comparing kind of like the transaction fees to not just protocols but also DeFi apps and things like that comparing it to Visa so Visa does 24 billion dollars in total fee revenue last year so Ethereum's catching up right the Ethereum already beat Stripe. Stripe does 7.4 billion dollars and obviously now you know I mean after August most of that fear of when you is being burned 70 to 80 percent of it which is absolutely insane right like this is revenues for Visa and Stripe right that goes I mean that's not profit right like that's revenues that go to kind of like paying for our staff paying for you know equipment paying for maintenance and servers and all that sort of stuff there whereas this kind of like 10 billion dollars I mean if you want to say that extrapolate that out and say okay well 1.559 if it was live for the whole year seven to eight billion dollars of that would have been burned so crazy crazy and then going down you can kind of like see some layer two stuff here like cumulative transactions on on layer two is up at over 500 million here or something like that there you can go down and see kind of cumulative transactions on well I mean this was this includes sorry this includes Ethereum L1 so you can see cumulative transactions of Ethereum L1 and L2 which is like about 500 million but maybe over 500 million here and then you can see just L2 on its own is up to almost 100 million I think that's about 80 85 million there so and you know it really only started in July as I said the second half of last year was when layer two's really started kind of taking off and they went live and stuff like that so some really cool stuff there some stuff around the creator economy and how much kind of like creators are earning on the platform so you know artists musicians writers and other creators obviously got to do with NFTs I really like this little picture here that says who makes a living in crypto you can see through the years like who's making a living now well in 2021 investors developers crypto companies and artists musicians writers gamers are all making money in in crypto these days whereas the previous years it was just like investors developers and crypto companies so very cool to see that some coverage of core protocol upgrades like 1559 you can see a nice chart here of 1559 adoption through time and yeah anyway I'm gonna let you guys give this a read yourselves as I said highly recommend that if you read anything this week make it this and I guess kudos to Josh Stark and Evan Van Ness for putting this together they do this every year by the way for the last few years always love writing them but as I said this got me super super pumped today for the past present and future of Ethereum. So speaking of 1559 Vitalik shared a paper today that was done by some researchers at Peking University and Duke University of the on the consequences of ERP 1559 and Vitalik says here I particularly appreciate the confirmation that ERP 1559 has greatly decreased average waiting times for transactions then he shares this little chart here now this is you know one of the other benefits or at least kind of like a major benefit of 1559 obviously we had the obviously we had the kind of like burn that everyone focused on but I've gone through before the other benefits of 1559 like better fee estimation you know decreased the average waiting time for transactions because you because of that so you don't have to speed up a transaction most of the time anymore and there was a few other benefits in there as well so really great to see some objective data on this obviously you know there's there's more time that needs to go past before we kind of like say that this is you know the an amazing fix or kind of like does what it says it does but I mean I think it's been six months so far and we can obviously see some some early data showcasing that it does what it says it's going to do you know the funny thing is is that Ethereum layer one is mostly bots today and like in the near future especially as more people migrate to layer two it's going to be basically 100 bots and these bots are basically going to have like very fine tuned ways to pay for transactions on the Ethereum network so it really is going to be a thing where 1559 is going to help so much that I mean in theory 99% or even more than that of transactions should never have to be sped up and and people can kind of get the transactions into the next block as long as they pay the correct fee obviously if you pay too low a fee you're going to be waiting but I'm talking about kind of like priority transactions to get into the next block that should that should definitely get better you know get uh be a be in a really good place for these bots and things like that as well on on layer one ethereum and you know the funny thing is is that myself and a few of the I guess like other eth og's and whales that I know in the ethereum ecosystem are now moving most of their activity to layer two as well so even the whales are pretty much getting priced out and this is because like when you think about it it depends what kind of you know how you know what what these kind of like whales are and how active they are but for example you know a few of them I know they love to do kind of like trading nfts and things like that they love to do putting their stable coins into yield farms and kind of like re-upping their their farms every day and kind of like compounding every day you know if you if you have token rewards coming to you and selling those token rewards but the thing is if you're doing that every day on layer one it's going to cost you hundreds of dollars in gas fees and it's not even going to be worth it uh you know I mean obviously depending on the size that you put in there but it's not going to be worth it for people who have millions of dollars in there to re-up it every day because the gas fees just eat into it like crazy so these people are moving to layer two as well because layer two is now have more to do you know an opportunity optimism they've got a lot more apps on there which I'm going to go through in a sec as well some some major apps went live today but essentially I think as I said one five five nine oh sorry layer one is really not even going to be whales anymore like maybe mega whales like people will have like a shit ton of money like maybe tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars but mostly it's going to be bots doing MEV stuff doing arbitrage stuff layer two is obviously posting their core data and proofs to the layer one network but anyway if you're interested in reading this research paper it'll be linked in the youtube description below so three other updates today so Stani is teasing Aave's L2 strategy where he says the current Aave L2 strategy is Aave protocol v3 Aave governance v3 and Aave redacted v3 I wonder what redacted v3 is because I know that Aave is building a mobile a mobile wallet or a wallet in general but I don't know if they'd call that a v3 wallet because they don't they haven't even had like a v1 or a v2 so I'm wondering what are they redacted v3 is going to be maybe I don't know maybe it's kind of got to do with the institutional stuff that they're doing I don't know I'm not sure but this is cool I'm really loving the fact that Aave is stepping up on their kind of like L2 game lately and you can see here a related update from Emilio from from Aave here that they've kind of got a proposal up on the governance forum right now to use our snapshot snapshot x from snapshot labs which I'm going to talk about soon on on starware here so as I said Aave is getting very very involved with the layer two ecosystem and that argent kind of defray integration that was being teased was actually Aave so you can now earn interest with up to 100 times lower fees than L1 by using the zk sync wallet so you can see here gif basically deposit not depositing usdc but trading usdc for a usdc which is Aave interest bearing usdc and on zk sync here using the argent wallet which I think is really cool you know the fun thing is is that yes okay this isn't like an Aave integration where through your argent wallet you deposit usdc directly into Aave but it's the beauty of defi is that you don't need to do that all that needs to happen is that you trade your Aave for a usdc sorry you trade your usdc for a usdc and you still get access to that same yield because of the fact that a usdc is a yield bearing token issued by the Aave protocol whenever anyone kind of like puts their usdc in there so this is really what this is really one thing that defi uniquely enables is those tokens that represent different kind of positions and different kind of things within the defi ecosystem it makes it really easy to do integrations like this without Aave having to deploy to zk sync you know as kind of like the core protocol and then liquidity having to flow in there flow into that to you know for it to mean anything what this can do is you can just tap into Aave kind of like liquidity anywhere and this is part of Aave v3's roadmap as well with their portal where they want to have like A tokens flowing from chain to chain l2 to l2 and have and you know no need to kind of like fragment liquidity like that as well which i think is really really cool so awesome to see this from arjen and aave and as i said like aave seems to be really doubling down on their l2 strategy now i'm very much looking forward to seeing aave v3 go live on both optimism and arbitrum which has been kind of like teased for a while now i'm sure they'll be going live relatively soon so very very very very excited for that so uh i'm really open c announced today with a bunch of different partners the nft security group so this security group has 18 different partners in it 18 very involved kind of like apps companies services within the nf within the nft space such as i guess foundation coinbase maker's place manifold meta mask polygon open c of course rareables or our wallet connect you can see all of them here i'm not going to list them all out but there's 18 of them so and the nft security group is basically a group that's come together to obviously tackle security and safety challenges within the nft space obviously the nft space is bringing in a lot of newer people and there's a meme going around that a lot of these nft people give away their seed phrase because they don't know what it is that um i you know i've made some joke jokes about it on twitter before about the board ape holders they seem to give away their seed phrases and lose their board apes and other nfts are quite regularly now as much as you know we all laugh and it's a meme and everything this is a real problem for adoption like you i like argent's approach to it where they're basically saying you know we need to get rid of seed phrases we shouldn't be showing users seed phrases at all and i agree with that approach because at the end of the day um this kind of like seed phrase a lot of users can get tricked into giving this away just like they've been tricked into giving away their password for for decades now in the web 2 world so if we get to a point where we can remove seed phrases or at least kind of like have so much education out there that we can reduce the number of people who are just like willfully giving their seed phrase or secret phrase whatever you want to call it away the better and it's not just that there's a bunch of other kind of like security practices for for nfts and just for crypto in general that are going to be worked on um but i think the the seed phrase is a major thing because look when you think when you kind of like just uh look at the reality of the situation if you give away your seed phrase those words 12 or 24 words have access to all of your kind of like wallets which means it's basically a private key right which means that anyone you give that that too has access to everything you have not just one asset all the assets so if you have an ethereum kind of wallet um whether it be on your kind of like hardware wallet or metamask or some some other thing um and you have ethan there you have stable coins in there you have nfts in there you have other tokens as soon as you give away your seed phrase or as soon as your seed phrase becomes compromised because you put it on your computer and someone's kind of like stolen it um you know the smart kind of like uh hackers are going to drain everything instantly right and you're going to lose everything with zero recourse there's nothing you can do about it then because obviously once a transaction has been done and confirmed on the ethereum network you can only roll it back if you have you know uh uh control of the chain which obviously is not going to happen so from that perspective again that's just a warning for everyone please never ever ever give your seed phrase to anyone never write your seed phrase on your kind of like computer and write it down and save it in a text file even if it's password protected or anything like that never do that it's the one of the most dangerous things you can do and it's also just bound to get you wrecked eventually so if you do have to store a seed phrase because you do get them with hardware wallets you do get them with something like metamask always write it down physically and store it somewhere extremely safe but also uh you you want to make sure that you kind of like um go beyond that depending on how much you you have as well if you have a substantial amount you can kind of like split up the seed phrase give i don't know give like half to your parents and keep half yourself to keep keep safe but also keep in mind that you have to trust them to keep that safe as well because uh not not that it could get i mean it could get stolen of course but like i think the bigger risk is that they just lose it or they forget where they're gonna like they put it or it gets damaged or kind of like it gets thrown out or something like that so these are the things to consider but this is again why we shouldn't really have users kind of i guess like being faced with seed phrases and secret phrases and things like that it's definitely a big deal that we need to kind of like deal with so i'm great to see that open scene a bunch of other companies and services and and ecosystem participants have introduced or launched this new nft security group to help everyone out here so as i mentioned an update from snapshot today so they've introduced snapshot x which is basically a iteration of snapchat snapchat snapshots which is the upcoming on-chain voting framework for trustless execution that is going to be deployed uh to i guess stark net so this is being worked on in collaboration with the starkware team it was previously known as a stark vote i'm pretty sure i covered it when it was called stark vote but now it's called a snapshot x so here's a description of what snapshot x is basically snapshot x is a voting framework built on stark net the layer 2 zk roll-up it will allow any dao to run their governance on chain on layer 2 and execute transactions on ethereum that's very very cool right like i've talked about this before about how people are getting priced out of doing governance things on layer one because of the fees so if we can do governance at layer two while still executing it at layer one that's awesome and that's exactly what snapshot x wants to enable here so very very very very happy to see that but also snapshot is good on layer one too because of the fact that you can just sign a message you don't have to actually do on-chain transactions so it's already obviously uh you know free to do because signing a transaction sorry signing a message is free uh but like if you want to go beyond that kind of like execute these things on chain and stuff like that that's when it becomes you know expensive so cool to see this definitely go give this blog post to read for more information about snapshot x here uh so polygon the their pos chain is integrated eip 1559 so obviously ip1559 as i just talked about brings through uh brings with a bunch of upgrades uh like better fee estimation better fee market things like that on polygon uh polygons pos chain here and i'm pretty sure they are burning matic as well but obviously because fees are much cheaper on the pos chain um the burn is much less i think they're burning like i know i remember that i talked about this on the refuel they were going back and forth about like burning or not burning uh but i know they are okay so they landed on burning the the matic token so uh but yeah then it's still cool to see like i can't wait to see some kind of like dashboards sprung up around you know how much matic token has been burned but i doubt it's going to be much as i said i am um uh sorry what was i saying i was saying that um you know the fear of a new is quite low because of the fact that the transactions are low and the funny thing is that doesn't mean the activity is low the activity is actually pretty high on the pos chain but um don't expect like ethereum levels of burn right like i mean i'm pretty sure the pos chain uh does like one to 200k worth of fear of a new on any given day compare that to ethereum that does like 50 million dollars a day yeah there's there's just really no comparison there but you know better than nothing but also you get those usability and ux benefits that come with 1559 generally so very very cool to see this um and uh uh yeah i i'm uh i can't wait to see kind of like how the polygon fee market evolves from here as well because they obviously had a bunch of issues with bots and things like that too and spam so i'm curious to see how that gets kind of like handled under 15 under a 1559 world for the polygon pos chain here so curve finance is now live on optimism so you can go to optimism.curve.fi and play around with curve on there just another app that's gone live on optimism since they removed the whitelist they were already live on arbitrum of course and i think they were live on zk sync or at least they had a testnet implementation on the zk sync so curve's moving fast they're obviously live on some other kind of like evm chains as well makes sense for all these projects to deploy to basically every evm chain i'm curious to see long term kind of which ones hold the um the most usage of the most activity obviously my bet is on layer 2 is because they're just objectively better from a speed perspective but like from a transaction fee perspective longer term they'll be better but for now i mean obviously optimistic roll-ups are still a few dollars for a swap and things like that whereas some of these kind of like cheaper centralized evm chains are very very kind of like low um low fees there but as i said roll-ups are going to get to that point eventually when we have things like eip4488 and sharding in place but it's going to be on a kind of like longer term thing there so just another thing for you guys to play around with on optimism though with with curve um both optimism and arbitrums ecosystems are pretty much i wouldn't say they're kind of like on par with ethereum l1 yet but they're getting there like they're getting there very quickly as i said ava v3 is getting ready to be deployed on both of them very very soon i i'm sure and then once that happens there's only a few other things that need to happen i mean uniswap is already live on there curve is live on there now they have their own exclusive apps like optimism has stuff like lyra uh arbitrum has stuff like dopex there's their own kind of like you know native ecosystems developing like um magic or treasure on albertrim as well and on optimism the synthetics ecosystem seems to be doing very well so these things are coming together really really quickly and i did tell you guys like it's kind of like a slowly and then suddenly thing where you think it's happening really slowly but then suddenly there's all these apps available for you you're bridging across you you can just stay on l2 there's no need to go back to l1 and we also have now with binance integrating arbitrum deposits and withdrawals that's just the beginning so really you know most of us in i guess maybe this year even probably won't be touching l1 very much at all if ever again and there's no reason for us to write the l2 migration is well on the way as i mentioned earlier i have a lot of um eth og friends um you know both whales and not and not whales i mean depends what you consider a whale but you know both whales are not whales they're migrating a lot of their stuff to l2s and being like you know it's time like l2s are finally where we need them to be and uh and and people are kind of like happy to to kind of um be on there instead of just being on l1 and you know i'm i've the funny thing is with my activity i notice my activity go down a lot uh because of the l1 gas fees like i only do uh my my kind of like weekly things like i have a few things i do each week but like most of my activity i tried to keep to to l2s these days as well but i mean it is always hard to migrate across depending on what's happening because you may have some farms on on l1 that you have to unwind and then re-spin them up on l2 again and you have and you may have to wait for things to be live as well because they may not be everything you need for me the reason why i haven't moved a lot of my stuff off l1 yet is the fiat on run-off ramps i don't use binance and the exchange that i use for fiat on and off ramps may not be supported for a while so i may have to use binance if i want to get off l1 go to i'll go to arbogen from now or something like that um but you know it would it kind of be kind of like i mean i would save some money but what would have to happen is that i'd have to kind of like do my stuff on arbogen for example or optimism whatever other l2 i then kind of like send those funds back to l1 so that i could send them to a to an exchange in order to trade it for fiat and you make you guys are you thinking why is he going to fiat uh taxes unfortunately i hate that i have to go to fiat but i have to for taxes like um you know half of it almost half of it goes to taxes which is obviously super annoying um but uh it is what it is so that's why i have to kind of like go to um go to centralized exchanges uh but i'm hoping more of them obviously support things like optimism and arbitrum so that i can myself get most of my stuff off l1 and go to l2 because the fees you know i mean the fees like i can look people always have this meme that kind of like the early eeth holders the people with lots of eeth don't care about the fees because uh because they've you know they they made a lot of money off e they have a lot of e whatever but this is wrong for two major reasons one i don't like spending thousands of dollars in fees like that's still thousands of dollars it doesn't matter kind of like how much money you have that's still thousands of dollars that you're spending unnecessarily if you can do that stuff at l2 but you you can do a lot of it now and two it's eeth so i'm essentially giving up eeth right like e that's going to be that i believe is going to be worth more in the future so if i spend a thousand dollars on gas fees in a month for example because that you know if you're a regular kind of like on chain user a thousand dollars in gas fees on layer one a month is on the low end of stuff like you could spend much more than that what happens if eith goes or when eith goes like you know 4x from here or 5x from here that one thousand dollars suddenly becomes four to five thousand dollars like and kind of like um when you really think about that and you kind of like take all the e that you've ever spent on fees kind of like over the years and the price point that it was at that point and what it is today it hurts like i went back and i looked because uh for my taxes i just went back and i looked through it all and i'm like holy shit like i spent so much eith when um on gas fees when eith was in the one to three hundred dollar range because i was doing um stuff on there wasn't as much to do on on chain but i was still doing stuff and and obviously um fees were much cheaper then but like if you're doing a lot of things you would still spend kind of like all this eith and then obviously when eith went higher and and like five hundred dollars something like that the fees started spiking but even then like i look back now eith's over three three thousand dollars so any eith that i spent on fees at five hundred dollars it's gone up seven x since then so if i spent like i don't know five thousand dollars worth of fees or it was more than that it was much more than that during d5 summer and then d5 summer happened when eith was like around five hundred dollars like i think eith when d5 summer started it was only like three hundred dollars or something like that so between three hundred and six hundred dollars i spent like you know tens of thousands of dollars during d5 summer and you go look back on that now and what eith is today it hurts right so when people say oh the ephogies don't care because they have so much eith it's like well they do care they don't want to have to spend like all these um this money on fees uh uh and just because they can afford it doesn't mean they want to do it and that's why a lot of them are moving to l2 that's why i'm trying to move as much as my activity to l2 uh and i said like l1 fee as i've said plenty of times l1 phase they're not coming down anytime soon guys like they're gonna keep getting up there especially as these l2 start competing for block space as well so so yeah just a bit of a lot of rants just a bit of a kind of like thing that i've been thinking about lately because i'm just like sick of these memes right like these these memes that people think like every every time like i talk about fees on twitter i get this just reply guy saying this sort of stuff to me it's like oh you're a rich eith og you don't care you have so much eath you don't care about the fees it's like i mean i do i do care about the fees like i don't want to be spending these i don't want to be you know using my even if i don't if i don't have to and yes i know that it gets burned right and and that's you know in some way contributing to the value of future eath but that's not the point the point is like i want to keep as much eath as possible in my pocket because i love eath i want to stack more eath so i can stack more validators and i think that's the same for everyone right it's not just the pain of paying the high fees it's also the pain of paying the high fees in eath now i know some people replenish their eath after they've paid it like by buying new eath but the thing is like when you think about kind of like tax uh tax implications and stuff like that as well it gets messy depending where you are but i know some people do that too which i guess like is a solution ish but like yeah i mean if you don't have spare kind of like cash lying on the sidelines you wait a few days till you have spare cash then eath price goes up or is different from where you kind of like um where you kind of like spent that eath it becomes a bit messy there but anyway i'll leave it at that last couple of updates to get through um there was a critical vulnerability in the multi-chain or previously called any swap bridge affecting six tokens uh weth perry omt wrapped uh bnb matic and avax so if you have any of kind of like approvals with the multi-chain contracts you need to go revoke these approvals before it's too late because this is still being actively exploited so you can check this out it'll be linked in the youtube description uh below i'll link the blog price for all the details here if you ever use this i don't i don't even know what these tokens are like perry omt i know the rest of them obviously but i don't know what these two are but if you're affected by that definitely go check this out uh you know right now even maybe i should have talked about this at the start but yeah i'm sure sure if you you know you you kind of like involved in this you probably saw it by now but definitely go check this out final i think talk about sam richards from the ethereum.org team uh put together some kind of like stats and some growth stats from ethereum.org so ethereum.org received 20 million visits in 2021 huge right five times the traffic it received in 2020 68 people are contributing to the project on github with which is two times the 30 contributors in 2020 and 3500 translators joined and translated nearly 3 million words um seven times the people and 10 times words translated since 2020 that's insane like that particularly to it's amazing saying 3500 translators man that just really speaks to how global ethereum is right like the ethereum.org website is available in in many different languages which i absolutely love by the way i hate that so much of kind of like i guess defi interfaces and things like that are only available in english ethereum is global crypto is global let's start getting you know these things available in different languages i know it can be difficult sometimes if you don't have um translators on board and kind of like getting things translated can be quite costly but a lot of these different projects have massive treasuries and spending some of that to translate the website into at least the most popular languages um maybe the top 10 would be well worth it but anyway great to see this growth from ethereum.org as i've said before to you guys ethereum.org used to be kind of like basically uh uh useless like i think that's the best way to describe it i think 2019 is absolutely useless it was it was old outdated hasn't hadn't been updated since like 2015 then a new team came together and had been absolutely crushing it like absolutely crushing it the ethereum.org website is one of my favorite websites or in crypto uh and and one of my favorite websites just in general right because it's just such an awesome site to go on there's tons of information and resources there i love the artwork i love everything about it but enough gushing from me congrats to the team there and i think i'm going to end it on that for today so thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give that video a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the discord channel and i'll catch you all tomorrow thanks everyone

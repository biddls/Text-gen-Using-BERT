 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the dailygue refuel where we cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host the anthony sosano and today's the 23rd of may 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So i'm sure you've all seen this already But I broke the trend or I guess my rule of not having guests on the dailygue youtube channel I spoke with kobe and everyone knows who kobe is I don't think I need to need to explain who he is But we had a pretty great conversation for those of you who watched it already Uh, you don't really need me to tell you that um, and this new series is called the dailygue drive-through I came up with that name in the shower Actually, I was kind of brainstorming the name in the discord channel what I would call this series and drive-through came to me I'm sure it's self-explanatory But I guess like what I wanted to just quickly say was I don't think you know Kobe will be the last person I have on um, you know I'm not going to do guests kind of like episodes like what you see on bankless or anything like that where it's got like A structured agenda and it's kind of like interviewing someone maybe because they've got like a product release coming out soon or something like that But for me, I will only be doing the guest episodes where I feel like I can have a really interesting Unscripted conversation with someone otherwise, I don't really feel the need to do it or see the point in doing it I want it to be kind of like insightful and entertaining as well for you guys So I don't know who i'm gonna have on next. I think I mentioned maybe someone like hell press I would love to have on Because I uh, we had a call the other day and we vibed really well and it would just be an interesting conversation I think but I don't want to I I don't think it's going to be like kind of like a regular Reoccurring thing. It's like it's not going to be like a once a week thing It's just going to be whenever I feel like I can have a good conversation with someone So yeah, that's kind of like what the guest episodes are going to be so I as I said like still kind of like um, you know, I guess maybe not sticking to my rule of not having Gressed on but like more more so I had that rule because I just didn't want it to turn into Like I didn't want the daily way to just basically become a bankless because we already have bankless You don't you know and then there's other platforms. Well that kind of like media, uh, too But we don't need another one of those right? So Uh, and also on that front i'm actually going to be bringing back the amas Um, I think from now on instead of doing a live ama I'm just going to kind of like gather the questions in the discord channel And then i'm going to pre-record it and upload it to youtube as normal doing the live amas was quite tiring Especially because I was doing them and like late at night like 11 o'clock my my time And they usually go for two hours and I wouldn't really be able to take like a break In between kind of like those those couple of hours there So yeah, i'll still answer the questions and everything and still bring back the ama series But I want to do it pre-recorded now instead of live and I live didn't really add anything because not many people actually ask questions Live they more so kind of like just listened in and they had their own questions that they had asked In the um, the discord channel itself So if you have questions go ask them there. I think i'm going to do one on this saturday I'll just record one with the questions that are already in there So if you do have questions you would like to ask please put them in there and you'll get there It'll get answered on saturday, but that's it on on the daily gray updates I guess i'm going to move on to the rest of the updates that we saw over the weekend All right, so you guys know about the protocol guild i've talked about it a bunch on the refuel before well over the weekend 2 million lido or 2 million ldo tokens has been contributed to the protocol Protocol guild pilots, uh from the lido kind of like treasury here, which is really awesome to see now At current dollar amount if I check the the ldo price here just to get the current uh worth of these tokens 1.28 so, you know, it's about two two point something million 1.28 times 2 million 2.28 times 2 i'm going to do quick math here for you guys 2.56 million, uh dollars kind of like contributed I think um, you know, I yeah that is yeah, it's in it's an ldo token So it was worth 2.7 now it's 2.56 because the price went down a bit I guess Contributed to the protocol guild so really awesome to see this Uh, this is the first but won't be the last that's for sure that's going into the protocol guild And you guys know what the protocol guild is basically the initiative to fund more public goods within ethereum Uh led by trent veneps and tim biker so very awesome to see that lido has contributed this especially because lido is such a major player In ethereum right now and i've given my thoughts on lido in the past About how I don't think it's kind of like constructive for us as an ecosystem to be attacking lido Just because they're a big part of the ethereum staking ecosystem Um, and you know, they're giving back to ethereum with this which is really cool But on top of that, uh kind of like let's just build better tools You know if we if you don't want lido to be you know as dominant as they are we have to build better tools And I know there's a few kind of like moving parts happening with rocket pool. Uh, they're kind of like discussing lowering that Minimum eith requirement to get more people kind of like spinning up nodes and things like that and and yeah There's a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes there. I think today or the past few days They were voting on doing ads in bankless as well Just like you know, you know i've said before that I thought that rocket pool should be doing more marketing Well, I think they're going to be doing that as well, which is which is awesome to see too. So yeah Anyway, great to see uh lido contribute here. Uh, hopefully, uh, we see some other kind of like protocols follow suit All right, so a massive announcement just uh kind of like announced a couple of hours ago from game stop that they now have a wallet So if you go to wallet.gamestop.com you can see here that it is running on ethereum layer one and is also supports Loopering layer two which is obviously, uh, you know in line with their kind of like integrations with looping in the past I'm sure they're going to be supporting immutable x as well in the near future So you can store your krypton nfts using this wallet you can download it here I believe it's a kind of like extension, uh wallet and a kind of like mobile wallet as you can see From the images here. I haven't downloaded it yet because I have a feeling it's going to conflict with metamask So maybe i'll just download it on my phone. Um, but this is self-custodial. This is not a custodial wallet So this is very very uh, you know, awesome to be self-custodial It allows you to interact with you know, all your favorite dapps on ethereum of course are both on layer one and looping layer two And uh, it's just really awesome to see such a big company make such a positive impact on the market Big company makes such a push into crypto right like releasing their own wallet is awesome And i've said before that I think the wallet opportunity is still huge and I think it's very very underexplored Like there was some talk over the last couple days about metamask and their swap feature And i've mentioned before the metamask swap feature. They take a 0.8 around a 0.8 fee on every swap They're printing cash from this guy's like absolutely printing cash Uh and making a shit ton of revenue off really just matching with they're not even kind of like doing the matching right there They're kind of like they've got a service that looks at the other decentralized exchanges and decentralized exchange aggregators returns the best price for the user Uh, and then slaps a 0.8 fee on top of it now i've discussed before how I think that that fee Kind of like is not really it's I mean, it's not really that meaningful, right? Because if you're buying any crypto token, like it's gonna Swing either way more than 0.8 every single day So it's it's kind of like meaningless for the end user Like I I mean and people are obviously farming the to the you know, the possible metamask token as well But I think that the other wallets are seeing this and i'm like, okay well You know We need to own the front door and that's why coinbase has a wallet and stuff like that as well because you want to own The front door you want to own where people kind of like, you know store their crypto even if it's a self-custodial way Because then you can make fees on things like swaps and like, uh, you know defi interactions And then you can kind of like have your brand as well attached to it and and kind of like do on sales from there So it makes total sense to me that game stop will do this I think this is just the start of kind of like these big companies releasing these sorts of things I think game stop is obviously going to put more focus on the nft integrations than the defi integrations just because of what they are But I think that's that's okay. Like the thing is is that Just because something focuses on one thing or another doesn't mean you can't actually use it for whatever you want to use it for If it's a proper self-custodial ethereum wallet You can use it for literally anything like and just because they have native integration with loop ring doesn't mean you couldn't potentially on board to something else Uh another layer two if it has adapt browser inbuilt, right? You can do basically anything So I I think you know from that perspective as like a wallet I mean there's not going to be that many like super sick successful wallets in the world But it's going to be a handful of them that really really uh, you know Do everything and people will kind of like just pick and choose what they like based on I guess brand and kind of like network effect and and kind of like, you know Maybe they just started with it and they kind of like locked in Sort of like how there's a lot of lock-in in kind of like different platforms, right? Like when you use something you're used to using it, you know, you know switching costs Maybe low but it's kind of like, you know, the this for you to switch would take Uh, it's something kind of like to be much better on the other side, right? So I can't wait to see how the wallet ecosystem shapes up. Obviously, there's a bunch of crypto native wallets You know, not just metamask there's argent rainbow a few others that i've mentioned in the past The battle is on the battle is on for the front door of crypto in the kind of like I guess on-chain ecosystem Obviously the off-chain ecosystem the front doors centralized exchanges, which there's already plenty of those, right? I don't think we need any more centralized exchanges at this point Except I think what's going to happen is that we probably won't get any more like crypto native centralized exchanges spinning up It'll be more the traditional kind of like exchanges Getting involved with crypto or banks and brokerages and institutions kind of like doing crypto support rather than them Setting up their own centralized exchange or something like that, but cool to see this from gamestop Definitely go give it a download and play around with it if you uh, if you'd like to So etherscan has released I missed this last week. Actually this happened a few days ago has released a testnet explorer for seppolia Which is ethereum's new testnet. So this is one of the testnets that will actually be running through the merge transition So we obviously have ropston on june 8th And then after that, I don't there hasn't been a decision on what testnet will run through the merge But there'll be a second one run through could be seppolia or girly and then the third one will be the one that didn't run Through on on the second there and uh, yeah seppolia is just basically replacing the ring Good i ework You All well, actually i don't halfway is Um getting deprecated for a bunch of different reasons and there is now a block explorer from Etherscan for this which is really really cool. So I can't wait, honestly guys speaking of test nets, I am just, oh man I'm so excited for June 8th, I'm so excited for Ropsten to go through this merge transition because that's when we'll know with like 99% certainty when the merge is going to happen. Right now I think it's like a 90% chance of August and look I put a really high percent chance on that and it could still obviously push to September but I think that if Ropsten goes really well, if there are no major client bugs or any kind of like bugs that the devs feel like they need to fix and they need to get done and that if it happened on May that would be a big deal right, then I think that August becomes like a 99% chance from there and I leave that you know 1% obviously for kind of like just because anything can happen but like yeah I believe that becomes that. I'm just like waiting like a kid waiting for Christmas right, just waiting for this kind of like date to come around so we can see this run through. There was the fifth Shadow Fork last week that I spoke about, I think there's going to be a sixth one, I heard something about it but I haven't really kept up with it and the Shadow Forks are going through just fine so I think just based on the Shadow Forks which are actually done on Mainnet, not the testnet, that the Ropsten testnet should go through just fine so very very excited for that but anyway a little bit off topic there but if you want to check out the Sepolia Explorer you can go to seppolia.ethascan.io. Alright so OpenSea did something very interesting over the weekend that I think was unexpected by a lot of people, they introduced something called Seaport which they're calling a brand new Web3 Marketplace protocol for safely and efficiently buying and selling NFTs. So this is basically their answer to LooksRare I think or their answer to kind of people saying hey you know OpenSea is like totally centralized, it should be a protocol, it should be community governed, blah blah blah. So given that they're releasing something like this which they're actually calling the Seaport protocol which is open source and going to be built out in the open, there's probably going to be something of a token I would assume right because, and not many people talk about this, it was weird, I'm speculating here, but OpenSea itself will probably go the IPO route right where it's kind of like the IPO, they're a traditional company that have OpenSea all well and good but then you're going to have Seaport which is kind of like their decentralized open source public protocol which will probably have a token attached to it right so they can have the best of both worlds. And the way this would work in terms of like making sense of it, OpenSea would be one of the vendors so to speak on their marketplace as well right on Seaport because people will trust OpenSea, they'll kind of like trust them as kind of like to kind of like route the orders through, you know Seaport will probably be like a kind of like a 0x thing where it kind of like just like routes orders to different marketplaces like Sys on top or something like that and you can have OpenSea sitting in the background. So yeah, I mean there's a bunch of different ways that this can go through but I'm really really surprised I didn't see more people talking about this because immediately when I saw that they're building a protocol, I immediately thought of a token and everyone had been speculating about OpenSea having a token for a long time and you know they haven't really spoken about it when it comes to this so really really weird but you know there's a few comments that I thought were pretty interesting. Some people were saying that they didn't understand what it would kind of like, what this is going to be right and I think this is because a lot of the OpenSea users are basically people who I guess are newer to crypto and don't understand what protocols are, don't understand how that kind of like all works together, they just kind of like go on OpenSea, they buy and sell NFTs and blah blah blah right but I'm looking below the surface here. I'm definitely seeing something more here from OpenSea and they seem to be signaling something more here so I mean whether they do a token or not like I still think Seaport is really cool just because of the fact that they're actually building a protocol not just staying at like the 100% centralized kind of website that they are with OpenSea, they're actually trying to build an open source decentralized permissionless kind of protocol that is a challenger I guess to something like LooksRare which is taking a bit of market share away from OpenSea but yeah I mean OpenSea just has such a strong moat and network effect and brand. I know people have different feelings towards OpenSea and kind of like especially around their moderation but guys like OpenSea is a totally centralized platform right and their moderation is usually done to prevent scams or prevent like you know illegal content or anything like that right but if you want like a truly open source protocol well Seaport might be you know decentralized protocol, Seaport might be the one for you right like maybe you can use LooksRare as well like don't get me wrong but Seaport is I think OpenSea's answer to this so I'm gonna keep a close eye on this even though you guys know I'm like big into NFTs I just still think I thought it was very weird that people kind of like weren't really talking about this over the weekend maybe just went under the radar there wasn't anything else happening it's not like we had another terror blow up over the weekend right the weekend was actually quite slow and the reason I know it was slow is because I had time to listen to podcasts I'm usually like on Twitter like oh god what's going on so yeah I'm not sure I know what people didn't pay attention to this but anyway definitely go check this out for yourself I'll link it in the YouTube description. Alright so SuperFia's highlighted Project Sunshine again over the weekend which is adding new metrics to better visualize decentralization on the Ethereum beacon chain so this is a project that I've spoken about before on the refuel but basically they're adding more metrics all the time here they've added I think last time I looked at it they didn't have metrics around these other kind of like metrics that are here so you can see here they have metrics around you know client diversity on the consensus and execution layers number of hosted validated market share non hosted validated market share geo location diversity so obviously where are kind of like the validators in the world and the execution layer clients in the world staking pool diversity you know staking entity diversity all that sorts of stuff and as SuperFia says yeah don't be disheartened by the current metrics seeing a path forward is valuable for change watch us get stronger so some of these metrics obviously look bad but at the end of the day so did the client diversity on the consensus layer right it looked very bad I kind of like it was in the red danger zone at like what 67% or something like that and I think maybe this is old data because we're now at like 56 or 57% not 61% so yeah I mean just because these things are kind of like red don't don't be disheartened by that it'll get better over time we'll improve those over time but just wanted to kind of highlight this from SuperFia's and there's also another tweet just a reminder here that there is still a little bit of time left to donate to all these staking related projects on qf.ethstaker.cc just wanted to remind you guys that that's still ongoing and it's similar to a get coin grants matching round where your donations will be matched so definitely go check that one out alright so m stable detailed or shared kind of like a primer on erc4626 today I would not say that I guess like a few days ago here which is basically the vault standard so the yield kind of like vault standard which I believe I have talked about before but this is basically as I described here helping to clean up the mess in yield bearing tokens so basically creating a standard for yield bearing tokens here and the reason why I wanted to highlight it not so much kind of like it's the standard itself because I've talked about it before but more so around kind of like DeFi is still innovating guys like and it's innovating in small but impactful ways and maybe boring ways to some people because I know that we had the whole DeFi 2.0 thing and this is something that I spoke about on the kind of like video I did with kobe DeFi 2.0 for the most part was just Ponzi's right there wasn't much innovation going on there whereas the quote unquote DeFi 1.0 the bought old boring boomer DeFi there's plenty of innovation going on there it's slow and steady because it needs to be because this is people's money at the end of the day and there's plenty of stuff going on there so I think I would encourage you all to kind of like just go back and look at these older DeFi protocols and see what they're doing because a lot of them are still building a lot of them are building out their v2s and v3s you know maybe even v4s right and a lot of them are innovating in ways in which like it's going to be very impactful but it's just slower than I guess like you would like to see and especially obviously because the tokens aren't doing much in terms of like price action but guys like I mean if you're watching the refill you care more about prices at the end of the day so if you do care about more about prices then you should definitely check out all the innovation happening across especially the older DeFi protocols because there's a lot there and it's very very encouraging to see so check out this one from MSDA we'll then go check out the other ones as well. Alright so we have an update on I guess Rockerpool here today from Jasper who says that the risk assessment team from MakerDAO has published its report on Rockerpool staking token R-ETH so basically this happens when Maker is kind of like wanting to onboard a new form of collateral so they do kind of like a risk report on it so you can see here that it was posted on the Maker forum and kind of like putting forward a bunch of risk parameters that would go in if R-ETH was onboarded onto the Maker platform as a form of collateral so this is basically one of the final steps and this definitely needs to be done to kind of like track things like supply, volatility, liquidity, all that sorts of stuff and kind of like how Maker would fare in kind of like liquidating positions with an R-ETH position and stuff like that or sorry a position that uses R-ETH collateral so this is exciting I mean the thing that's benefited ST-ETH a lot I think on top of it you know obviously not being as capital constrained as Rockerpool is for staking is the fact that ST-ETH is on money markets right like from memory it's on Maker it's on R-VARE it's on a bunch of the other ones where you can essentially do this recursive kind of staking right where you put ETH into LIDAR you get ST-ETH you put that ST-ETH into like a money market you borrow more ETH and you repeat this process to gain a kind of leverage stake right which is obviously risky but a lot of people are doing it because it boosts your yield so you know that this could be potentially possible on Maker with kind of like R-ETH sooner rather than later so just wanted to kind of highlight that for you guys I think it's super exciting I mean I like this sort of stuff obviously if you're aware of the risk it's cool but I think if you're not aware of the risk don't attempt this like you're definitely at risk of being liquidated especially so you're not just at risk of being liquidated because like the ETH price goes down you're also at risk of being liquidated because of the peg going under so there was a discussion last week I think on the review I discussed that around the ST-ETH peg kind of like you know it becoming deep pegged there and if it reached a certain kind of like price I think it was 0.95 ETH positions would start getting liquidated so you are basically at a higher risk than a normal leverage position so just keep that in mind of course but I think that you know Lido responded to this actually pretty pretty pretty aggressively they put a bunch of LDO token incentives on a new kind of like pool to encourage more ST-ETH and R-ETH and ETH liquidity in order to get the ST-ETH peg back but I mean it's not a peg it's okay sorry it's not technically a peg because it's not kind of it's not a peg like people call it a peg but it's not really a peg it's more just like you want to keep the values in line so that you can always kind of like redeem for you know redeem kind of like one for one right or like for like assets there but you know as I said like if it drops below a certain threshold then positions start getting liquidated like that or if the ETH price drops it you know it would start getting liquidated too as a normal kind of like I guess leverage position there I think I'm thinking that through correctly I'm just thinking that through the implications off the top of my head right now because you're borrowing ETH and then you kind of like got ETH's collateral right so yeah yeah that should that should make sense someone correct me if I'm wrong maybe I'm maybe I'm having a brain kind of like fart I don't know but yeah anyway cool to see this from from Maker definitely go check out the blog post for more details I guess like forum post for more details if you'd like. All right so Nick Johnson from the ENS team put together a kind of like tweet with a with a I guess like a screenshot of a spreadsheet maybe saying May is now an all-time high for every single ENS metric we track registrations, renewals, revenue both in ETH and USD and income in ETH and USD as well and there's still a week left of May left so you can see here basically it's just been growing over time right the trend is growing this is 2021 at the top and year-to-date 2022 at the bottom it's just been consistent growth on the revenue side on the income side and in both ETH and USD obviously registrations and renewals as well this is awesome I mean you guys saw that Coinbase basically integrated with ENS last week so that's going to drive more adoption here as well and as Nick says here there's still a week left of May which should see even more growth now will June be as big who knows hopefully it is right but the general growth trend for ENS has been basically up only and you know you can kind of like I guess see where they introduced the token right because like it spikes up from October to November like pretty pretty heavily but it's still can it still continued that and there's been no promise or talk or guarantee or anything of there being another airdrop so it's not like people are trying to farm an airdrop with with registering a ENS names and if they are they're just wasting money because like there's not going to be another airdrop to ENS names unless the Dow votes on it but I don't think that they would ever vote for something like that so so yeah anyway cool to see ENS continuing to grow here one of my favorite projects in the Ethereum ecosystem obviously and I wish them you know even more success in the coming months alright so Aztec the privacy kind of like roll up on a theorem announced a two million dollar bug bounty apprises for disclosure of critical vulnerabilities in their code base so this is pretty big I think this is one of the biggest in the ecosystem right now you know I was actually looking at kind of like the biggest bug bounties before because I came across wormhole the cross-chain bridge and they paid out a ten million dollar bug bounty to someone who found a critical bug in wormhole back in February so I believe back in February was before that the hack that happened the other bug that was in their code but yeah they paid out ten million dollars back then to one person for finding this bug that's a crazy payday like I don't know if this person was already wealthy or not but even if they were you know imagine if they weren't imagine if like they were just some kind of like person who was interested interested in kind of like finding bugs and you know maybe just a dev or something like that and they're just any funny bugs and they were really really good at it and they did it and they just got a ten million dollar payday that's that's just well like I can't even think through the implications of that for someone like even as I said even if they're already wealthy that would be huge amount of money for them and if they weren't that would be life-changing literally life-changing for them it would have it would set them up for life just just from finding that one bug so you have so many of these opportunities to find bugs like if you're if you're into that sort of stuff if you think you can teach yourself to get to that level there's so much money to be made guys like here's a two million dollar kind of like bug bounty prizes for for critical vulnerabilities optimism also has a million dollar bug bounty I think polygon does as well now there's so many of these things so if you find those critical bugs you know instead of exploiting them yourself and not being able to cash out the money pretty much ever like it's just going to get traced and tagged and whatever just be a white hat report the bug collect the bout bug bounty money and away you go right so yeah I mean there's just so many of these things now I like literally if you found a couple of bugs like critical bugs across these things which to be fair aren't easy to find especially because a lot of these things have already gone through multiple audits and and things like that but they do exist obviously we've seen plenty of exploits they do exist there's big money to be made if you're into that sort of stuff if you want to teach yourself and then go and do it you can probably set yourself up for life potentially right all right last thing to talk about here was optimism sharing a tweet thread over the weekend called this governance will self-destruct and the tldr of the tweet thread is basically that optimism's approach to governance is that they want it to be a continuous kind of like iterative process where they destroy the governance and then rebirth a new governance from that so they basically like a take up like a phoenix rebirth approach to to governance and I think this is really cool because what's typically happened before is that protocols get stuck on like one governance design and then don't change and there's no kind of like framework in place to change it there's no leadership to change it there's just kind of like here's our governance if you like it you like it if you don't you don't if it works it works if it doesn't you know if it doesn't work it doesn't work whereas all divisions like now screw that we're going to actually do it so that we constantly iterating constantly self-destructing and rebirthing as a new governance with the learnings from the old governance that we had and I think this is going to be again a gold I've said this before but like I feel like optimism is just kind of like leading the charge here becoming the gold standard for both governance and token models and I can't wait to see how this plays out this is a grand experiment playing out that will influence a lot of different governance designs as time goes on and it's not just them element finance has been doing a lot of great stuff around governance as well get clean is experimenting with a bunch of things like there are a lot of really cool Ethereum protocols that are doing really cool governance things right now but I think optimism is approach here of like consistently not just iterating on their governance but literally destroying their governance and starting again with learnings from their previous governance kind of like framework is something that I haven't seen before and something that I'm really really excited and bullish on so give this thread a read I'll link it in the YouTube description but I think that just kind of like generally I haven't seen this from from any other protocol let alone layer two teams and you know I'm kind of like wondering how long it's going to be before another layer two team reveals their governance and token plans because obviously we know some of them are going like for sure going to have a token I mean we are let's be honest guys that we all we know they're all going to have a token but like you know zk sync has announced that whereas arbitrum hasn't announced and it's dark we haven't announced it right so I'm curious to see kind of like what they come up with if theirs is going to be similar to what optimism is doing if they're going to take from optimism is kind of like playbook and apply it to their own there's so many different ways to do it I think just generally maybe some of them will avoid just outright copying optimism even if it is kind of like a really good design because they want to kind of differentiate themselves but you know I kind of like think that that doesn't need to happen I feel like differentiating for the sake of differentiation is kind of like pointless if there is a model that that works really well then you can still do experiments with your own model but like you should go if it's already working really well there's no point reinventing the wheel just for the sake of it so I hope that these other kind of like layer twos don't try and just like change things just to be different to their competitors for example I hope that they work together I hope they come up with better governance and token distributions kind of like frameworks together and I hope that as a community we can collaborate on all sorts of stuff because as I said plenty of times before we haven't figured out how to do good token distributions yet we haven't figured out how to do good on-chain governance yet we're probably not going to figure it out for a long time but it's going to take even longer if we don't work together so I feel like we should all just work together regardless of what ecosystem you're a part of maybe you only hold OP tokens and not Arbitrum tokens in the future it doesn't matter guys like I feel like if we all kind of like are in the Ethereum ecosystem and these projects are all Ethereum aligned then we should be supporting as many of them as possible and obviously there are competitors across every kind of like category DeFi NFTs whatever but if they're adding value to the Ethereum ecosystem then we should just support them right and like I that's what I try to do like I don't support projects that are kind of like extractive and purely kind of like don't want to add any value to Ethereum actually want to take value away from Ethereum and signal that but I do support all the projects that will add value to Ethereum especially those that donate to public goods like I those are like the perfect projects in my mind well not perfect but like they're like the best projects in my mind so so yeah anyway go check this out I'll link in the YouTube description but I think that's going to be it for today so thank everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give it a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the Discord channel and I'll catch you all tomorrow thanks everyone.

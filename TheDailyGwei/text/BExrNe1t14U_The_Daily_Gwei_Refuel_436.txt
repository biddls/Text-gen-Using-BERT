 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily gray refuel where a cap ladies news in the etherium ecosystem I'm your host the end and it's a signer and says it's 26th of August 2022 Everyone let's get into it so coin sinner is out today with a detailed factual explanation of how a tornado cache works Now this is quite detailed I read through it today And I kind of learned a lot about how tornado cache works under the hood in even more depth I've obviously got a good understanding of how it works, but this goes very very deep into it and basically Has a whole overview of how the contracts work how things like the relays work how the mixing actually works? how the compliance tool works because for those of you don't know to know to cache actually had a compliance tool that allowed you to Essentially prove where the funds were you know we're going to and where where they went via a PDF report because of the fact that that cut the compliant the the cryptography powering tornado cache allows you to do that so You know it's kind of funny How far tornado cache went to make sure that they provided everything for for users and made sure that the users could kind of like? Protect themselves from certain things, but I mean you know we still saw what happened with the ophax sanctions But I do want to give a huge shout out here to coin center They have been so active with I guess like since the ophax sanctions happened that they've been trying to educate as many people as they Can they've been putting out posts like this? And they really are a great non for profit organization within crypto in order to kind of like bridge that gap between crypto and the The kind of politics side of things right and the regulation the law side of things they've been at it for a very long time It's obviously coincidence obviously nothing new here, but they've been doing a lot of amazing work Especially around tornado cache since these sanctions hit so I mean I'm not gonna say that you should that you have to go donate But as they are non for profit they basically are funded through donations I believe they have an eighth Address at coin center dot eight that you could donate to and they typically have a coin grant spun up as well So I just wanted to give them just such a shout out here because they're doing instrumental work and a very very important work that I mean few of us actually have the Knowledge and know-how and access to do at the end of the day if you want to convince lawmakers if you want to convince Regulators you've got to speak or in their language you got to play in their playground. I can't do that I mean I have a have a an understanding of how things work, but I I don't think that would kind of like listen to me I don't think I'd be able to prepare the proper statements whereas coin center does that they act as our bridge which I think obviously Is extremely important I? highly recommend going giving this this detailed explainer a read if you if you just want to learn all about tornado cash and all There is to learn about it, and how the tool is not made to enable money laundering right the tool is a tool It's made to allow anyone to essentially Protect their privacy because blockchains just not do not give us privacy by default except You know I mean I shouldn't say no I shouldn't say all of them obviously manure and Z cash allow for for privacy at layer one But most blockchains out there especially a theorem does not do not give you any privacy So we need these third-party tools or any of these these kind of like applications that are built on top of these networks to allow It and and yeah, I mean as I said go give this blog post to read I'll link it in the YouTube description below for you to do so Alright, so I wanted to highlight this amazing little staking setup here. I shouldn't say little it's a pretty big staking setup Here that David Theodore shared to super fears, so he's basically got a setup running on a starlink And is powered by our pure solar power here in a caravan so he obviously David here is a bit of a nomad and you can see he's set up in his caravan here And you can see the solar panels, and you can see basically you know him kind of I think this is in Canada I believe is this no it's in it's in there are different pictures in different places so one of them was in Colorado And forks wa I don't know what wa is it. I don't know what down state that is in the US I may be Washington northern CA which I'm assuming is California, but this is just so cool I mean as I said the other day I love that super fears started this trend because there's this popular narrative I guess within the wider crypto circles that no one can run an ethereum full node you know no one runs You know so no one solo stakes. No one's a home validator well here You have someone who's literally off-grid Running validators, and he's not only running mainnet validators I believe he's running girly validators as well testnet validators and also fuzzing a beacon chain clients Which is part of testing the merge so I mean David is just I guess like the quintessential ethereum going off-grid Living the life basically as a nomad visiting awesome places and you know still being able to run validators on the network validators on the network and if you obviously if you go to the state from home hashtag, there's a lot of New setups there since I covered it last time really really cool a bunch You know I'm actually surprised by the amount of knocks there are It's kind of funny because like a knock as I explained on the last refuel It's the easiest piece of hardware I guess to buy you can slap like a dap node on it and just make it super adapt node is a There's an op is a piece of software you can slap on it and just make it super easy to stake But yeah, there's so many knocks. There's raspberry pies there's full blown server racks There's so many. I mean there's avatos here as you can see which come pre-loaded with dap node There's even some Mac minis and stuff like that and yeah, I mean you could see all the setups Which I think is very very cool I just love this sort of shit guys like you guys know that from day one I had my own PC set up to stake with staking from home I was a beacon chain Genesis validator, and I've added many validators since then to my setup I Can't think of anything more I guess Important than being a solo stake on the beacon chain as in a theory and that should be everyone's goal if you're a true a theory And I know that the barrier to entry at 32th is quite high But that rocker pool for example is lowering that barrier you can do it with 16th right now They're planning to lower that even more in order to run those those mini pools Yes, it is not like a hundred percent the same as solo staking and fully sovereign solo staking, but it's close enough I think you know I don't blame people for not being able to get the 32 It that is that is a very high barrier to entry It's the highest barrier to entry and maybe that'll be lowered in the future sometime But if you do have 32th, and you're willing to put it up I mean as I said before staking is not risk-free But you're willing to put it up for staking you should always go the path of Solo staking in my opinion it is the best way to stake Second best I would say at this point in time is probably rocket pool because they just got such an amazing decentralized setup there But if you have the 32th required solo staking is definitely the way to go You don't have to go as as as all out as David here has done with solar power and starlink and all that you can Obviously run at at home, but I guess this is David's home right like and he's just gone the extra mile So I wanted to highlight that and and talk a little bit about how I think it definitely does reflect You know the ethereum kind of ethos of running You know on grid or off grid running a node running a validator that is what? It what being an ethereum means so very very cool to see this Thank you to David for sharing it and thank you for a to super fees again for getting this trend going you know Maybe I don't know if he's doing this if super fizz is doing this maybe someone should create a website where we can have pictures Of everyone staking setups or just you know basically document everything and all the tweets on there So that we can just scroll through it from time to time and see and just get inspired But how many people are staking from home because honestly I felt inspired scrolling through all of it Because it's all well and good for people to say oh yeah, I stake at home. Oh yeah, I do this Oh yeah I do that But it's it's another level to actually visualize it to see these boxes to see people's different staking setups and to see that it really Is different for every single person like no staking setups are alike just because someone has a the same knock as someone else doesn't mean Their setup is the same they could have any number of different setups going people get really creative with it as David here is dumb I think we'll have like breadboards with raspberry pi is attached a kind of like cable tied to it and And linking them all up so you can get as creative as you want with it at the end of the day like you guys Have seen my setup. It's I mean. It's just a basic PC It's it's nothing over the top, but I put like a figurine in it I put a little car in it, and I put it like a metallic sticker on it So I made it my own like that's the whole point you make it your own and you are contributing to the security decentralization And just well-being of the etherium beacon chain which obviously is is very very cool But yeah, I'm gonna move on from that just wanted to highlight it for everyone today Alright, so I missed this a couple of days ago, but Cain Warwick from our synthetics has put out this tweet reset the other day I found out that eip 48 44 if it is bandwidth constrained And this is the proto dank sharding effort the same thing happened in the early days of one five five nine work in 2019 I spoke to Tim biker and offered to help bounty fun bounties with up to 100,000 SNX I just sent out the first batch, so that's about three hundred thousand dollars I believe at current SNX price So it's nothing to scoff at and you can see on eat the scan here are the transaction that it's bad that the first batch Has been dispersed out which is very cool to see but yet came was pretty instrumental in getting eip one five five nine Across the line with or I guess like getting work to actually begin on it in earnest because of the fact that there was you Know bandwidth constraints, and there was money constraints and all that and he's using his platform And he's using things like SNX which I assume is his SNX to get the ball rolling here And this is this is this is really cool that he's gotten the ball rolling on 48 44 You know I I don't have any timeline still on proto dank sharding. I feel like It's kind of funny. I was thinking about this just before the merges is very very close now But it's kind of we're just waiting at the moment like the main net clients are out They're all published and everything like that besides the geth bug I think the rest of them the rest of the core devs are probably just you know doing running-the-mill testing Doing kind of like as much as testing as they can and make sure everything's all well and good But other than that I feel like people are itching to move on to the next thing they want to be able to work on The next upgrades coming to aetherium now that the merge is pretty much done we're just waiting for it to be activated on main net and Aip 48 44 is at the forefront obviously we need bacon chain withdrawals And I think recent advance has showed us that we need them much sooner than then we otherwise would have but that's like a relatively basic Thing to do I think the only hold up with bacon chain withdrawals Is that they want to see the chain running for a while on the proof of stake? Before they do another hard fork we do another upgrade which is fair enough right now obviously want to give the core devs A time to kind of like step back a bit take a break because they've been working so hard on the merge for so long But the IP 48 44 is definitely something that should be at the very top of the priority list edge simply because We have the window opportunity right now where the markets quiet It's a bear market the you know the usage is relatively quiet So we can get this out by the time you know if the bull market comes back next year Hopefully by early next year we have proto dank sharding live on the network and then we have those very very cheap transactions at layer 2 because In my mind the worst thing that could happen for aetherium is that we have these layer twos live But layer one hasn't kind of given them what they need through proto dank sharding and we have these massive influx of users again And they still don't get the benefits of of layer 2 I think that that's one of the worst things that could happen now Do I expect the bull market to come back anytime soon? I have no idea. I think that Arbitrum has proven and an optimism I should say as well has proven that just because the bear market doesn't mean that they can't saturate their activity I mean you saw arbitrum saturate its activity very very quickly Via the Odyssey program, and that's restarting soon nitro is a week away from from today less than a week away from today so I'm assuming odyssey is going to restart shortly after that and The then they're kind of like just filling up that capacity like it You can't just so this is the thing with with scaling and this is the thing with offering more block space You offer more block space especially valuable block space especially aetherium block space right you offer more of that Developers are going to fill it users are going to fill it and then use back to square one That's why scaling is a never-ending thing like we're never going to get to a point. We're like okay aetherium scaled enough Let's not you know let's not scale anymore It is a constant thing scaling layer one scaling layer two and all the other stuff around it right there I know stock ways been talking about layer three and layer four and things like that But it is an ongoing process just because people say oh, it's layer two summer Or it's this summer that summer At the end of the day like it d5 summer wasn't just a kind of one-time thing for d5 like obviously d5 summer was very Very active and there was a lot going on, but d5 building hasn't stopped since then There's a lot of innovations that have come out as a lot of d5 products that have gone live since then You know obviously most of them fail because that's just the way it is with with things like most things end up failing But the things that have a succeed and continue to succeed such as unisop as the quintessential example is doing amazingly And they're there. I'm sure v4 is going to be out soon sooner rather than later at least be announced sooner rather than later Which is you know obviously going to probably change the game again? I think you new stops got a good track record there, but but yeah, I think we need 48 44 ASAP I don't think we're getting it until earliest early next year. I think beacon chain withdrawals might come as its own separate hard fork which would mean that we might not get per a dank sharding until Q2 at the earliest next year, so we're going to have to see I'm just literally throwing out dates right now With not much context behind them It's not like the merge dates that I used to throw around where I actually had context behind it Until the merge is done until a few weeks after I don't even think I'm going to have an any sort of accurate picture on What's going to happen here because I don't think that the core devs even have that they know What they want to build they know what they want to do, but it's all about priorities And I think as I said beacon chain withdrawals have been have become a bigger priority than they once were But so is the IP 48 44 so is scaling like that That's the problem with things that are all high priority you have to kind of you know put something as like critical priority And I don't know if I consider beacon chain withdrawals to be critical priority at this point. Yes They are high priority, but I do think that 48 44 is is just as important But we'll have to see as I said I'll keep you guys up to date on any kind of context around dates that I come Across but right now It seems that everyone's just waiting for the merge holding their breath wanting the merge to go well and go smoothly and then we can Move on to talking about these next upgrades that are coming after the merge All right so a new update out of obel labs here today, so a sheen on Twitter Posted surface as saying surfacing today after a crazy last few weeks to say we have released Sharon a version 0.1. This is our biggest release jet and he's based on everything We've learned from rolling out our first test net Athena, so you can go to github and check out the release here But you can read oceans thread here as well for a description of what what what happened here? I'll read a little bit just to give you an idea so he says over the last month We've had 100 over 100 distributed validated clusters created by our community and most of them have been able to get up And a testing on girly it is hugely encouraging to see something you have worked on so hard on get picked up and loved by ego enthusiasts the biggest feature in this release to flaunt is Sharon now supports blinded beacon blocks and MeV boost shout out to See sierra here sierra and yet for the hard work on this and the tekko and lighthouse teams for assisting We've also spent a huge amount of time improving Sharon's self healing such that it can handle boot node failures better Which have had to deal with a lot over the last month due to unprecedented demand very very cool to see that this DBT from oble is coming along very nicely it seems here. I think that this blinded beacon blocks I I haven't heard of that before but I wonder if it's got to do with With the shutter eyes beacon chain I spoke about the other day if I just google blinded beacon blocks I'm not coming up with anything here No, I'm coming up with a Minecraft results. Okay, so that's not relevant there. I wonder what that is I actually have to have to see what blinded what blinded beacon blocks is so I because I think that that sounds like The shutter eyes beacon chain and what I mean by that it sounds like you may be able to have No, maybe not. I don't know. I'm just speculating here. I'm not going to kind of like go too deep into that But maybe it's on the github if I go here github Mmm, blinded beacon blocks anywhere no, maybe it's an oble specific thing I'll have to kind of like look into that and get back to that but very cool to see that Version one out is out here of Sharon Which is which is kind of like obles technology here and dvt is going to obviously play a very big and important part Post merge with staking it's something that's going to help a lot with Decentralization of the beacon chain and I mean as a practical example here basically what this allows For is that you can retain ownership of your and custodianship over your keys when staking But you can outsource the staking to a centralized exchange like coinbase for example, and they can run the validator for you So I think that's the simplest example of this But it's a really powerful one because it means you don't have to give up custody of your eighth When we kind of like staking it yes, there's still obviously slashing risk and things like that But it means you can kind of keep the keys on your own you can exit at any time without needing permission from the I guess Staking service provider to exit now that's going to be mostly important post withdrawals But yeah these technology is very very important so great to see this latest release here So if you're looking for some beacon chain decentralization data super fees has a list of websites here That will give you everything that you need I have gone through a bunch of these websites on the refill before such as eat sunshine Calm client diversity org and a bunch of others here This is project sunshine which has got to do with measuring the health of a theorems decentralization I remember highlighting highlighting this a while ago, so it measures things like consensus client diversity execution client diversity And and a bunch of other things like geo location diversity staking pool diversity and stuff like that Which I think is obviously very important like if we want to You know ensure that we have these healthiest beacon chain possible We need to be able to monitor metrics and have accurate metrics and also educate users on how they can help improve the metrics Too so that's the project sunshine client diversity org is that website that I kind of went through the other day I'm going over what client diversity looks like on both the consensus layer and execution layer We all know the execution layer needs some work here But that's going to be a focus post merge And then there's a bunch of others like rater dot network ethereum pools beacon chain like you can go check this out I'll link them in the YouTube description But these are ways to keep up with the ethereum beacon chain specifically And things that surround that and things that surround proof of stake so definitely go check all those out I'll link it in the YouTube description below Alright so Eleanor here from a16 crypto has announced that a 16 Z is committing $300,000 for open source developers in the next round of gitcoin grant which is gitcoin grants around 15 Which is happening next month on September 7th to September 22nd. This is awesome I love seeing big name VCs like a 16 Z giving backyard. That's a that's a that's a healthy chunk of change yes I know a 16 Z has billions of dollars and all that good stuff But at the end of the day like $300,000 is is quite large for something like this And this is just one thing that they're doing. I think it's kind of funny because a 16 Z and these big name VCs they cop a lot of flack for their investments And they do invest in a lot of things and inevitably you know some of those things are not going to be You know great investments are not going to be things that we agree with I do want to make two notes here one They have a lot of money from the rounds that they raised and they have to deploy that money if they don't deploy that money The investors will take that money out and go elsewhere and then a 16 Z loses business so to speak right so they have to Deploy that money and in that means you know when they've raised billions and billions of dollars Putting money into basically everything that is even half decent right and then secondly they do a lot of work outside of crypto from what I can tell especially on like the regulatory side because they have so much money and they have bad connections They can do things that we may not ever be privy to but have that paid dividends And there's also things that we are privy to like them committing $300,000 to Open-source developers on Gitcoin grants, so I sometimes kind of get annoyed when people I guess like put all the VCs in the same bucket so to speak because there are extract the VCs out there I mean I've gone on record before and I've made fun of them on Twitter a lot multi coin capital for example They're very extractive. I believe I don't think that they really a net positive for the ecosystem They extract a lot more value than what they put in it's kind of and it's kind of hard to quantify this as well But I think I don't think I'd bucket a 16 Z in there. I don't think I'd bucket paradigm in there I'm just thinking of like the big name VC a bit the really big name VCs. There's a bunch of others out there as well But when you're looking at these sorts of things like I know it's easy to say all VCs are evil But I don't think they are and I think that a 16 Z didn't have to do this They didn't have to send $300,000 to get coin grants here and and kind of basically donate it to them here So I'm really happy to say this I hope they continue to do this because this is going to go towards funding public goods Which you guys know I mean if anything on public goods maxi right at the end of the day, so Good to see this, but I'm always curious to hear what you guys think like I'm not trying to defend anyone or put anyone on a pedestal here. I'm not an investor in a 16 Z myself I I pretty sure I've co-invested with them on various projects, but that doesn't change my opinion or anything I just want to see more nuanced takes a lot of the time when it comes to to investors Especially ones that are giving back to the community. That's critically important. We need to support that as well So yeah, I guess like thank you to a 16 Z a crypto for doing this really really appreciative of it All right, so compound has announced today that compound v3. I guess is alive So compound v3 is a streamlined version of the protocol with an emphasis on security capital efficiency and user experience This is a the largest upgrade compound has done in quite a while I compound has been quiet for a while right like they obviously kicked off DeFi summer in May June 2020 with the complicated mining and They were instrumental in in just if I saw becoming as big as it was but in terms of like Their strategy over the last couple years. I haven't really agreed with that They tried to do their comp chain thing which didn't materialize They've been very slow to deploy to other networks whether they be a layer twos or side chains And now they've come out with v3 very very you know I guess like Very very long after v2 now. That's getting that out of the way I still think this is a pretty cool upgrade that what they've kind of kind of done here So it basically includes advanced account management tools for developers And a new UX for applications to be built on top of the protocol like a starter interface as you can see here and there's a bunch of markets that have been launched with with with compound v3 That allow you to borrow USDC using e wbt see link union comp And over time the protocol will support more assets on more blockchains So as I as I've talked about before they are planning to expand to other Layer twos and layer ones and side chains they've just been kind of slow on that front there And and yeah, this is um this is this is live right now Which is which very I live on the ethereum mainnet. I should say which is which is very cool to see um And I think the biggest upgrade as you can see in the second tweet here Is that in collateral remains your property so nobody else can borrow or withdraw it? It's safer while you won't earn interest on the collateral you'll be able to borrow more with less risk of liquidation And lower liquidation penalties while spending much less on gas I think that's a pretty big feature because as I've mentioned before In a lot of these money markets when you put the collateral in and then if that collateral goes to like a hundred percent borrow Then you have to wait until some of it gets paid back for you to withdraw And it can become like a you could be locked into a position for a little while there depending on market conditions So this is really cool And you know I kind of like was saying that compound moves slow. I don't actually think that's an overall negative. I think you want Certain projects to move slow instead of moving really fast and trying to add everything just for security reasons because at the end of the day in terms of like I Would have to say in terms of where I'd put my money And to borrow against it. I still think for me maker would be number one I would I would still put my e-tint to make our borrow against it on there because I think make would be the most secure But then compound and are they're pretty much tied. I think for me. I've used both of them I've used I mean I've used like all of these kind of money markets And it's just about what I feel most comfortable with based on a variety of factors And I would say that make us definitely first and then compound and are there would be tied for second here And I think are they even I mean I even are they doesn't move that quickly They'd be much quicker to deploy in other chains, but in terms of major protocol up to upgrades They still move relatively slow. I think compounds are the slowest of the bunch maker is definitely the slowest of the bunch, but Yeah, but compounds is is probably the second slowest there, but again That's not necessarily a bad thing slow and steady secure And making sure that the protocol doesn't get hacked or exploited people don't lose money is a very very important thing But yeah, that's why it's probably taking so long for compound V3 to come out, but it's live now You can go use it and I'll link it this in the YouTube description below for you to learn more about it I finally here we have the arbitrum and nitro white paper that has been published just in time before arbitrum nitro Goes live on main net so you can actually go here download the PDF or just read it on github and see the entire I guess like nitro All the details about nitro here now. They're calling this a second generation optimistic roll-up So this is not just like a small upgrade guys nitro is an absolutely massive upgrade for arbitrum It's why it's taken so long for for it to come to main net, but you know what's funny I was thinking about this other day. Not only has arbitrum Done nitro they've also done arbitrum Nova which has read it using it right and that's actually gaining traction as well So they're hitting it from multiple fronts right now, which is very very cool. They're managing the ecosystem very well They don't have a token yet, and they still have a lot of usage which is very impressive I must say and they just keep they just seem to be kicking all the the right goals here Which is very very awesome to see so if you want to read the white paper I'll link it in the description for you to do so it's not that long. It's not that dense either I think it's only about 15 pages So you can go check that out if you've read a right paper before you know exactly what you're getting yourself into But very cool for them to publish this just in time for arbitrum nitro here Which which I'm super excited for personally, and I hope they restart Odyssey rather quickly so I can get back at it Because I was having a lot of fun on it, and then it basically got paused because of the network getting low And I totally understood that hasn't actually been that long right it's only been a few weeks since they pause that I believe So it's good that they were able to get nitro out relatively quickly, and I can't wait to see it grow live I can't wait to see them scale up, and I can't wait to see all the layer twos continue to scale right like obviously Optimism Bedrock is coming towards the end of the year zk sync Is ek VM main net is coming within like 60 days or something polygon has their zk VM coming to main net Hopefully by the end of the year as well Scroll has their zk VM stuff happening to like There's too much happening in the layer to space now for me even keep up with anymore. Which is amazing I love it when that happens, so I would obviously be covering it on the refuel But I'm super excited to see all this stuff I think we're gonna get like a really strong close to the yard on the layer to front and Are you leading into next year hopefully the I guess market heats up again so that we can get more users in and hopefully we Have you know that that scale there for? For users to take advantage off so they don't have to go to other chains They can stay on the theorem and get all the benefits of aetherium with the cheap and fast transactions Which is what we all want at the end of the day, but I think on that note That's gonna be it for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give me a thumbs up Subscribe to newsletter join the disco channel, and I'll catch you all next week.

 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Deathe Gray Refuel, where we cap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Stanley Nissen, signing off on the 23rd of September 2022. Alright everyone, let's get into it. So some fresh regulatory news out today that isn't actually positive, it's actually quite negative. Now this was announced on Twitter by a bunch of various people but this tweet from DB reads, the commission defines the Uki-Dao unincorporated association as those holders of Uki tokens that have voted on governance proposals with respect to running the business. If you are a Uki token holder who voted on governance proposals you just got charged. So the original kind of thing here is that the CFTC is charging the Uki-Dao, which I believe was BZX before it was called Uki, for the offering of illegal off-exchange digital asset trading, registration violations and failing to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. This is obviously pretty serious charges here but in their kind of charges they also define the people who are holding the governance tokens and have used those governance tokens to vote on things as people that can be charged as well here, which obviously doesn't really make much sense. It's a big overreach and this is disappointing coming from the CFTC who have traditionally been I guess more friendly than the SEC at least, but it seems they're all going down the same path now where they're trying to I guess use as much power as they can even if they don't have that power to go after things like DeFi. And we all knew this was coming right, like we all knew that DeFi's I guess regulatory issues were only going to get worse from here, but this sort of stuff is just way overstepping right. It just doesn't really make any sense and there's a few takes here from some lawyers. First one from Jake Trevinsky who said the CFTC's BZX enforcement action may be the most egregious example of regulation by enforcement in the history of crypto. We've complained at length about the SEC abusing this tactic but the CFTC has put them to shame. And you can read Commissioner Mersinger's dissent here as well which I'll link in the YouTube description. And then Jake continues by saying it's deeply disappointing to see the CFTC damage its own reputation like this among those who care about the future of crypto in the United States, especially at a critical moment where while it pitches itself in Congress as the right agency to regulate quote-unquote digital commodity trades. So I mean I totally agree with Jake, it's very disappointing here. And where he says you know this is regulation by enforcement rather than regulation via kind of the traditional and the proper means through the law and things like that. What he's basically saying is that this is kind of going to lead to a chilling effect. I mean the goal would probably be that chilling effect where the same is with OFAC where they went after tornado cash they wanted to put a chilling effect on mixers on Ethereum right and for people using that mixer. So the same is true with this is it seems like the CFTC is coming hard against a small player like Uki or BZX. They're very small actually now they used to be a lot bigger back in the day but they're tiny now because BZX's history is pretty bad actually. I think they've been hacked like three times they just didn't really ever get product market fit and now they're being charged with this. So what ends up happening is that they go off to the smaller players because they're the ones who can't fight back right can't afford the nice fancy lawyers can't afford to to kind of go through all the motions to fight back against this. And then that leads to a chilling effect for all the bigger players or leads to essentially these bigger players over complying or you know complying way more than they should sort of what we saw like with the OFAC sanctions. And I think that because the OFAC sanctions seem to work so well at least temporarily these other agencies are probably looking at that and being like wow okay you know these guys are just going to fall over these guys are just pushovers we can just do regulation via enforcement without having to actually prove any wrongdoing or have to go to court or you know settle with lawyers we can just scare everyone into compliance. That is a really shitty thing to do but not surprising and also I don't think it's going to work long term it'll for sure work short term but what's going what will end up happening is if they keep going down this road these institutions and regular regulation regulatory bodies keep going down this road of enforcement by by sorry of enforcement in example of regulation by enforcement so I should say what's going to end up happening is that a lot of play a lot of people businesses dows whatever they whatever you want to call them are going to leave the US they're going to go somewhere else which is more friendly to them and that's going to be a huge blow to the US because we all know we all believe that crypto is the future of of not only finance but of a lot of different things within a lot of different industries and if the US wants to take such a hard line stance against that and scare off all the talent well that's very bearish for the US's kind of outlook within crypto. Now as I said this is a short term thing in terms of it working so medium to long term it would result in that or these agencies basically they try this and then it doesn't work and then they maybe play ball play fairer but I don't know I don't really trust any of these agencies to do that and this is just very very disappointing and there's a couple of other tweets here one here from a twitter account called Chairman Burb Bernanke who said the CFTC themselves has never defined a Dow this way this is the first instance even Messinger can find of this definition I don't think this is how the law should work this is an admission that you can be charged with a crime that's only defined when you're charged now that's a key point there now basically the way they've defined a Dow here is that the Dow isn't defined as any one token holder but as anyone who voted during a time period this means you can be in the Dow by being a token holder but if you vote for anything such as a higher interest rate then only then are you liable so this is really like stupid and as they pointed out here this is an admission that you can be charged with a crime that's only defined when you're charged which is obviously not a fair way to do justice it doesn't make any sense and it is again a massive overreach here so I think that all in all this is very I mean I wouldn't say it's bearish or scary or anything for DeFi I would say it's concerning in that these regulators are trying everything they can it seems to come down on crypto without actually having the power to do so they're trying to do that chilling effect they're trying to scare people and I mean it worked for OFAC so the SEC and the CFTC are probably looking and being like okay well let's just do the same thing let's just scare people into compliance scare people into over compliance and to their I guess credit on this like I mean a lot of DeFi is easily scared especially the DeFi projects that are based in the US they're the team members obviously don't want to fall afoul of the law at all and they've got lawyers and stuff but still they don't want to have to spend time on that so they definitely over comply when they when they shouldn't and last up here is a tweet from from Drew Hinks about this who says CFTC brings here just basically announced that first regulatory action against a DAO so charging OokieDAO with operating an unlicensed FCM seeking disgorgement restitution civil monetary penalties trading and registration bans and injunctive relief this is a you know these are obviously very serious charges and they've kind of gone the full full nine yards here and they're doing it against the DAO as well and as I said they defined a DAO as basically the token holders who vote on things not just the token holders themselves but you have to actually actively participate in governance and what I find hilarious about this is that most of the people who hold these tokens never ever participate in governance and that's not because of legal liability at least not for for most people it's because they just don't care to right and this is just going to actually have a more chilling effect and make people not want to do it because in case they they are breaking a law here but the way I view this is it's basically as I said again it's basically trying to do that chilling effect but the chances of you getting in trouble for voting on something in a DAO is the same chances of you getting in trouble for pirating copyrighted content right like it's just in theory I mean yeah you may be doing something wrong but in practice you're probably not going to get prosecuted for it or get any anyone coming after you they usually go after the source you know in the terms of pirated content they usually go after the distributors and then in terms of a DAO they would probably go after the people actually building the I guess DeFi app that is associated with the DAO because it's just a better way to to do it and and it's basically impossible to go after every single little individual right but still concerning not great I think that we're going to have to just like see how this folds out over the next few years there's going to be fighting over this within potentially in the courts but outside of the courts between lawyers and I mean at the end of the day the winners from this are the lawyers like all the DeFi teams are probably like holy shit like I need to be prepared for this I need to probably get lawyers all these sorts of stuff but we'll have to see what happens there but on that note there was some positive news over the last 24 hours on the regulatory front which I guess is related to the regulatory fund and that is that GitHub unbanned the tornado cash organization and contributors on their platform which means that the tornado cash code is now live on GitHub again which is awesome obviously I remember I spoke about this when the OFAC when OFAC sanctioned tornado cash the first time and GitHub was very very quick to take it down because of the fact that it was on the sanctions list now the code itself OFAC actually stated that here on the 14th of September that U.S. persons are not prohibited by U.S. sanctions regulations from copying the open source code and making it available online for others to view which means that GitHub is not liable if it's on their website because it's not actually illegal for them to do that so it's really really cool to say that they've unbanned it now uh still I mean look GitHub is obviously a pretty big centralized point of failure for a lot of our industry because everyone uses it to store code and yeah okay it's open source but I mean at the click of a button they can remove that from their platform so we definitely need to still kind of encourage these centralized versions of GitHub or putting code in multiple places not just on on one mega centralized website because GitHub is owned by Microsoft for those of you who didn't know so obviously one of the most centralized and U.S.-centric companies in the world that is definitely not going to uh not going to fight for us right uh and because our industry is still so small comparatively but also uh we should just have the code on multiple different places but still cool to see that this was unbanned uh as I said some light positive regulatory news in the face of that really shitty CFTC news over the last 24 hours. All right so Terrence from the prior uh Prilabs team tweeted out one week since the merge everyone around me is just working on withdrawals and 4844 can devs take a break please? I remember I said uh you know uh after the merge that or leading up to the merge that the devs were actually going to take a four to five week break uh until after DevCon in order to recharge their batteries but as I said before it seems like they are so I guess like there's so much momentum after the merge and they they feel so I guess motivated to keep working on stuff that they're still working on withdrawals and 4844 which are both uh tentatively scheduled to go into the Shanghai update which is absolutely awesome I mean both of these things are major upgrades right I mean technically withdrawals being enabled isn't a quote unquote upgrade but it's a feature that is needed to complete that loop of proof of stake Ethereum you know some some could argue that I mean you could make the argument that Ethereum is not a 100% full proof of stake network as it exists today because we don't have withdrawals enabled it limits the network still and I would actually agree with that argument so that's obviously coming as soon as it can and then 4844 is that proto dank sharding which may not seem urgent right now considering demand is quite low gas fees on layer one are low which means gas fees on layer twos are low and layer twos are scaling in their own ways as well uh independent of layer one but we still want to get that shipped we still want to get that on the network because that future proofs uh you know the the scalability of Ethereum for quite a while and when the demand does come back and we do have a lot of new users coming back they're not going to have to contend with Ethereum layer one's exorbitant gas fees because the gas is going to go back up definitely I have no doubt about that just because people are on layer twos instead of layer ones doesn't mean they're still not going to be plenty of people on layer one there is still like 50 billion dollars of TVL even at these depressed prices on layer one so there's still a ton of activity on there and so the fees are going to go back up but because we have these layer twos live and they have ecosystems built out as well they're going to be the preferred place for people to go that don't want to or don't have the ability to pay those high gas fees and nor should they have to pay those high gas fees so I'm obviously looking forward to both of these for completely different reasons I'm looking forward to withdrawals because I want us to close that loop and also enable people to withdraw from somewhere where they're not comfortable staking anymore and go stake with another provider maybe they want maybe they staked with Lido originally now they want to change to Rockerpool because when they staked with Lido Rockerpool wasn't out right and maybe they don't want to take that that haircut from selling the st which isn't actually too bad these days but maybe they would just rather withdraw everything that they have from the the bigger chain itself or maybe they staked with Coinbase and want to go to Rockerpool or maybe they stacked enough ETH during the bear market that they want to become a solo staker now and originally they put their ETH into Coinbase maybe they put like 20 ETH into Coinbase because that's all they had at the time and then they were able to stack more and now they have the 32 ETH necessary to solo stake and then they're going to go do that or maybe people have just seen all the ofax stuff and being like holy shit like I need to get my ETH off these centralized places because it's at risk of of social slashing it's a bigger risk than going with us you know a solo staker or a decentralized pool such as Rockerpool so we're going to see that great reshuffling with withdrawals but I'm I definitely want to see that as soon as possible and obviously 4844 proto dank sharding speaks for itself at this point because I've spoken about it so many times but we need that as well to go into the the network to future proof Ethereum scalability for I guess I don't know how long it would future proof us for it just depends on the kind of demand that we get and the kind of applications that get built but it does give us a you know at least a one to two years I would say at least and it shifts the scalability to layer twos from there so layer twos will have a lot of the work that they're doing on their own to upgrade their own networks and that would feed into the upgrades they get from 4844 as well all right so ethereum pools.info put out another great tweet thread today they said some research on ethereum multi-block mev how likely is is it for a pool controlling p percent of the validators to propose k consecutive blocks in an epoch so ie kraken will propose five consecutive blocks once a month on average but don't trust the random tweet more info so there's a thread here about this and I like where they said but basically uh sorry I like the the table that they've got here where they show what the chances are and I've spoken about multi-block mev before as you guys know in proof of stake uh the next block proposal proposal is known so everyone on the network or everyone viewing the network can know who the next proposer is and if you know that you're going to propose consecutive blocks well then you can do multi-block mev so for example within an epoch all 32 block proposals are known in advance and this is new improve of stake and enables new ways of mev of course such as manipulating uh twop or time weighted average um price oracles now if you are a coinbase or a kraken or someone some entity that has a lot of stake and say you see within those 32 block proposals that you have a window where you are the next five block proposers well you could technically come up with a strategy that takes advantage of that with multi-block mev and essentially you can control uh which transactions go into which blocks in those five blocks in order to get the most mev profit possible out of that now in practice we haven't seen this yet uh this thread goes through that which you can I'll link it in the description below for you to check out in practice we haven't seen any of this right now and it you have to be quite a large entity to actually to to actually uh propose blocks like that consecutively I mean you basically have to be one of the top ones here coinbase kraken or binance and then after that it's kind of very hard because lido even though lido has 30 of the network are a little bit under 30 actually right now the operators are who are proposing the blocks lido themselves isn't a monolithic operator they have those 28 29 I think it's actually up to 30 now uh operators that are proposing the block so unless they collude to do something uh because these these operators are independent unless they collude it's not going to happen under lido but when it is a single entity like coinbase kraken binance and a few of the others on this list then of course it becomes more of an issue but in saying that like we're only at the start of a potential multi-block mev world and I don't think there's many people out there who actually know what strategies to run in order to do this and you can imagine if a coinbase or a kraken or a binance starts doing this they're going to get publicly shamed for it and maybe they're going to lose stake so maybe it's actually in their best interest to not do any multi-block mev even though the profits would be larger and just because that could potentially lead to an outflow of each stake on their platform and then obviously less fees for the e that they already have stake with them and that could net out to actually a negative and the negative press would be pretty bad for them as well so there are things here that prevent them from doing this but we shouldn't just rely on that and that's why we're obviously working a lot of ways to minimize mev as much as possible and we're obviously working on ssle so that you basically don't know who the next block proposers are going to be in the beacon chain which is very important I guess not just for mev but also for dos risks so for example if you know that binance kraken coinbase or whatever are going to propose you know the next block or the next x amount of blocks you can potentially dos them and prevent them from doing that so there's griefing attacks and things like that obviously it's quite difficult but still we want to the way we all operate in ethereum is we always think of like the worst case scenarios and build around that that's the strength of ethereum is that and that's why things take so long is because we don't want to just settle for the maybe scenario right we want to settle for the okay this is the worst case scenario and this you know there's a hundred percent chance of this happening how do we prepare for it because at the end of the day even if the chance of it happening is basically zero percent it doesn't matter we need to go in with the assumption that there is a hundred percent chance of this happening at some point in the next you know 10, 20, 100 years like ethereum is trying to build itself to be a network that is resilient for centuries for thousands of years potentially right like that that is literally what we're building ethereum as a network that is resilient for that long and in that world we have to consider all of these possibilities and uh i work to to minimize the risk of them happening or to eliminate them all together so that's what i've always loved about ethereum and i think that we've still got that ethos and we're still building with that in mind uh and i don't think that's going to change i really do think that everyone on the core protocol side of things understands this and wants to build for that so that's really promising but i'll link this ethereum pools that info thread in the youtube description below and you can go check that one out all right so speaking of ethereum core development francesco here has published a new post on the ethe research forum called view merge as a replacement for proposer boost now this is a long and technical post here but you may be familiar with proposer boost which was basically one of those fixes that was put in place in order to prevent manipulation of the fork choice rule of ethereum and cause the chain to kind of like split up and things like that so this is a proposal called view merge that would replace proposer boost and it seems pretty promising from my reading this thread does a does a good job of breaking it down and how it all works but i just wanted to put it on your radar because i think it's very important because proposal bruce was like more of a band-aid solution than a permanent one and if we can come up with better solutions then definitely we want to get them into the network so i'll link this in the youtube description below for you to check out all right uh and la no no this is this is different this isn't called protocol work so i came across this project today called i mean i'm gonna butcher the pronunciation here it's called arctisium arctisium yeah i think i think that's how you say it which is a very interesting project and it's fully on chain and permissionless p2p nft marketplace on stark net and now they're live on the stark net girly testnet so you can check out their 101 article here to learn all about what they're building but yeah as i said i just came across this project today i don't know much about it i can't vouch for anything like that but i just wanted to put it on your radar because it's another project that's gone live on stark net and is obviously live on the testnet right now but will hopefully be live on main net sooner so you can check it out and you can go check it out all right so as tech announced today that they've recently made an upgrade to the aztec platform that removes a layer of trust from the aztec core team which is the subsidy contract so now it allows any party to fund subsidies for bridge transactions and bootstrap volume on aztec take for example a bridge that supports 50 unit transaction batches they give it like a bus with 50 seats which only departs for its destination once the bus is full on any given day three things could happen all 50 seats get filled and the bus is full on any given day not all 50 seats get filled and people wait for a bit before the rest of the seats get filled or someone at some point gets sick of waiting and pays for the whole bus to go down to ethereum and execute there's someone in three scenarios could be an individual the bus service itself and the bus service itself protocols who want their bridges to be performing even before a bus seats are selling out can subsidize regular departures ensuring a timely performance so uh previously as tech did this did these subsidies for people but now it says that the bridge contract has been deployed that allows any eoa which is just a normal ethereum address or contract account account to subsidize bridge contracts under a certain set of parameters bridge id subsidy amount committed and bridge contract backstop so you can read the thread for full details on this but this is very cool i've talked about this before i think i haven't talked about in a little while now but basically this thing where we would have teams and projects subsidizing people to bridge into layer twos from layer one obviously these days it's not as low but as i said before that we expect layer one fees to go up again so when when that happens the subsidies are going to be even more important now we obviously don't want to just limit this to the teams themselves having to do the subsidies but anyone can do it and anyone could do it for any reason i would imagine that projects on these networks would want to do it to encourage users to onboard to their project and subsidy through through that way uh but as as as tech said here anyone can do this with their um with their with their tooling sorry with the contracts that they've deployed now i hope to see this on not just as tech but all the other layer two networks out there uh i hope to see some centralized exchanges doing this that'd be really cool not sure what they would get out of that maybe they do it and then kind of take a cut if someone uses a defo protocol because they have like a front end for it i'm not sure what it would look like in practice but they could do it for their users so but they would want to obviously even be making money out of it because subsidizing means they're at a net loss if they're not making money out of it in some way but the layer twos are definitely motivated to get people into the ecosystem because in the long run it makes them money it's kind of like how paypal originally did that thing where they gave i can't remember the exact amount it was like 10 or 15 dollars to all people that signed up for a new account and it's kind of like how banks do teaser rates and things like that so that's just to get customers in the door and obviously you don't expect 100 of the customers to stick around but the percentage that do stick around make up for the ones that don't over the lifetime of their usage of the platform so that the same is true for defy apps layer twos whoever it is subsidies can work if done correctly all right so an announcement here from eth.limo today so the eth.limo ens gateway now supports rweave and ipfs swarm swarm content hashes users can now utilize every ens compatible storage layer ipfs ipns swarm skynet and rweave this is very cool i uh i think obviously this is much more important these days than it's been in the past especially in the age of the ofact sanctions on tornado cache and also these other regulatory things that have been coming on down the pipeline lately so yeah i always want to encourage projects that are doing this because at the end of the day every front end in defy should be on these platforms should be on one of these platforms at least to fight off against any centralization concerns so a great job here from eth.limo today all right uh last up here before i go into a bullish rant so you guys are going to be excited about this one uh just a shout out to uh eth global here who was doing an optimism summit which has been i believe it's already finished uh that you can go uh view on but uh there's a lot of uh people talking as part of this summit or people that did talk as part of this summit around all things optimism but also ethereum layer one uh the modular op stack everything around that so i just wanted to give a shout out to this you guys can go give it a view i'll link it in the youtube description below but finally to end off today's episode and to get you bullish into the weekend i have a tweet thread that i put out just before talking about a week since the merge uh and how that's affected eth issuance so it's been a little over a week since the merge right if ethereum was still on proof of work the supply of eth would have gone up by about a hundred thousand and this is factoring in the burn as well but because we're obviously on proof of stake the supply of eth has only gone up by five thousand this is a 95 reduction in net eth issuance obviously including the burn as i mentioned that is more than the triple harmony because the triple halvening only ever accounted for the block reward issuance or the protocol issuance i should say it didn't factor in the burn now this is a 95 reduction with the burn being not deflationary because the gas fees are so low right but this is huge like 90 like think about that for a second 95 right that's a massive reduction now in further tweets i put numbers to this right dollar numbers to this so i said we can extrapolate this out to a year's worth of issuance this is remember this is only one week so i did i did a naive math on this and i just times that by 52 weeks it would have been 5.2 million eith under proof of work in a year it's only 260 000 eith under proof of stake again this is including the burn in dollar terms at the current price that is seven billion dollars under proof of work and only 350 million dollars on the proof of stake and again this is over a year period guys like this is this is absolutely massive the reduction especially when you put a dollar value to it if we want to go to the all-time high and put a dollar value to it well what we would need to do is it would go 5.2 million i didn't do this before but i'll just do it quickly now times five thousand dollars which is around the all-time high that was 26 billion dollars a year of proof of work issuance that was needed to be eaten up just to keep the price at flat basically you know just to keep the price flat we needed even more than that for the price to go up right now let's do that at five thousand dollars in a proof of stake world of 260 000 times five thousand that's only one billion three hundred million so 1.3 billion as opposed to 26 billion right massive massive reduction there now i went on and continued and i said i'm going to make you even more bullish most of that proof of work issuance was probably dumped by miners since they had to cover operating costs and it definitely was i mean it's not a probably i don't know why i use the word probably there it definitely was dumped by miners to cover that those operating costs but on top of the operating costs they also want to take profit for themselves right like it's not just the oh i'm a miner i'm just going to pay for my operating costs and then keep the keep the rest of the e forever no they're going to sell it for profit and some miners even held on to it to stake it which is even better but most of the proof of stake issuance after taxes will probably be held restate since operating costs are significantly lower than proof of work and i've talked about this lots on the refill before you guys know all about this and then i said in the last tweet once the market heats up again and average gas prices are back at only 15 gue plus because that's the current ultrasound barrier the issuance will be net negative of course as more if you stake the higher gas price we need to keep e deflationary but more e stake is good for the price as well so and you get where i'm going with that right i've gone through this before but there is such a beautiful feedback loop here with the way the entire ethereum monetary policy works i don't think we're perfect yet i do think that obviously the merge and 1559 are the core pieces of each monetary policy they're probably there's probably going to be some tweaks to it in the future specifically around things like capping the maximum amount of active validators on the network at once so aka the maximum amount of e30 staked actively on the network at once that's been talked about and i've mentioned it before and then i think there's one other thing that i'm forgetting right now but as it currently stands this is just stupidly insane now you want if you want to compare this to something like bitcoin right we can go back to our favorite site moneyprinter.info which i've got which i've talked about before so moneyprinter.info i believe factors in the burn as well here and oh man ethereum ethereum is not on this at the moment damn okay i saw it the other day so i can i can say what it is so we can look at the issuance of um of bitcoin right now daily issuance 17.6 million dollars is issued to miners which has to be sold then we can look at salana 3.2 million dollars it's not issued to miners issued to stakers but still it's it's quite a lot but avalanche 1.1 million and these salana and avalanche both have much lower market caps than than um than bitcoin and ethereum as well right so if you kind of factor that into it as well it's actually on a market cap basis a lot of issuance uh and then i think eth fell actually under dogecoin dogecoin is currently paying 800 000 a day to secure its network now i think ethereum was just under 800 000 including the burn at around 0.17 percent issuance rate that is insane like i mean that is a crazy amount it's like 20 times less than bitcoin guys and so i know people have looked at the price recently especially the eth btc ratio and thought to themselves well if it's so bullish why did eth btc go down because short term is irrelevant short term is always dictated by uh short-term narratives and traders the medium to long term is where you're going to see the effect of this issue introduction play out and i've gone through this plenty of times before and i sound like a broken record at this point but you're going to see it play out over the longer term i i i'm not going to promise you that i'm not going to guarantee you that but i truly do believe that these flow changes are going to have an absolutely massive impact in demand periods because instead of requiring 26 billion dollars a year right if it was five thousand dollars to secure uh the um the the sorry to uh to uh to to make up for the minor dumping we would need a considerable uh less amount of that so just naturally because of that eith should trade lighter like i mean the math adds up right this isn't and and the logic adds up this is not something where i'm living in fantasy land and i'm making up fantasy things if the demand is there like imagine if the demand was i think i mentioned this yesterday it meant the demand doesn't even have to be anywhere near the same as it was during uh last year or the year before uh well i guess probably last year is better uh it can be less than it was then and it should trade light up just based on that massive change in the flows there so hopefully that little rant there has made you bullish uh into the weekend i know i am i mean you guys know i'm still buying eith like especially at these prices where i feel like it's uh it's it's a bargain bin prices can it go lower of course it can the macro environment's still really shitty we don't know what's going to happen uh with inflation and the fed and things like that everyone has their own opinion on it my personal opinion is is generally that i think we're over the worst of it just from what i can see but i'm not a macro expert i've got absolutely no idea when it comes to that sorts of stuff but from what i've read and the experts that i have read and from what i'm seeing it does seem like we're over the worst of both inflation at least in the us and also uh the i guess shock from the rates going up i think everyone expects the rates to go up for a little bit now i don't think anyone expects any shock rate rises unless inflation is still really high but from what i've seen the next month's inflation numbers in the us should be uh less than them than last month and the months before and the trend is still down on it as well but as i said not an expert on macro environment uh and because of that i actually don't really think about that too much when it comes to my eath purchases i purchase eath or like crypto generally on a relative basis to where it is i think right now as i've mentioned plenty of times the market and just crypto in general is in the period that we were in in 2019 where everything's dead sentiments in the shitter everyone's just like accepted the reality of the situation but i think in those situations lies the most opportunity just like when i was selling stuff last year i was thinking to myself um well okay like the market's stupid right now the amount of money coming in but the amount of money that needs to keep coming in to keep the prices up at these sustained levels not just for proof of work coins but all these other coins that were vesting out all these tokens uh when i did the math on that i was just like okay this is absolutely crazy sentiment was crazy uh it felt like everyone was getting rich like in those kind of scenarios if you've been around for three cycles now like i have you look at that and you're like okay i get why people get kind of caught up in this but i've been to this before so i'm gonna rely on my past self's lessons to apply that to future to the future me and to the current me and make sure i play defensively here don't feel bad if you don't know how to do that especially if you've only been in it for one cycle as i've said to you guys before in 2013 was my first cycle i traded away most of the bitcoin that i bought and then i sold in 2014 during the bear market because i was a noob like i had no idea what i was doing i'm pretty sure if i remember correctly i lost like 90 of what i put in during that time just over trading and then selling it at a loss and just doing all sorts of stupid stuff and then my second cycle was the 2017 one i learned from the lessons of 2013 my biggest lesson was not to leave during the bear market and then this cycle was where i got most of the reward from from my time in crypto uh and as like that's a long time guys it's like eight years right not eight nine years since then that i've had to learn those lessons so i think that you have to learn it yourself no one can really teach you those sorts of things you can learn from other people but there's a difference between knowledge and wisdom wisdom is definitely based on experiences knowledge is just based on obviously me telling you this and other people telling you this and telling basically they're telling you their experiences but unless you've experienced it yourself there's a very big disconnect there so i know that there is a mix of people who watch the show listen to the show you're maybe a long term you know two or three cycles maybe you've only been through one cycle and you've only been through three cycles maybe you've only been through one whatever you are like it's always the same story there are bear periods there are bull periods you just need to know how to handle each of them regardless of the amount of money you have put into crypto or the amount of money you've made from crypto it doesn't matter like that that's actually shouldn't factor into it at all what factors into it is knowing how to handle the cycles and knowing how to profit from them but i'm not giving trading investment advice on this channel all i'm trying to do is say that you need to learn for yourself you need to think for yourself and you need to be prepared for a variety of different outcomes and it never hurts to take profit guys like honestly i know it might be hard during bull markets to do that i know that you may regret it because the price is going up but the bigger regret is not taking any profit and then losing because maybe you get scared in the bear market and sell and you're like holy shit like everything seems really really bad right now i've got to sell sell sell sell right like i've i've been through this i know how that feels it's not a good feeling so just that a little bit of it um a little bit of advice going into the weekend a little bit of bullishness on eve going into the weekend but on that note that's going to be it for today so thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give it a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the discord

 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the other great refuel where we cap the latest news near theorem ecosystem I'm your host and this is ano and taser anth of march 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So I saw this kind of like tweet from time magazine today with vatalik on the cover So vatalik has been featured in the latest edition of time magazine and the title on the front of uh, I guess the cover here is the prince of crypto has concerns ethereum created Vitalik bitter and fights to fix the world he created now the piece is actually quite good Um, I I read the piece just before so it's kind of like fresh in my mind So there's a few things I wanted to talk about here So I guess what vatalik was mainly I guess, uh concerned about what he has concerns about is the technology that we're all kind of Like using crypto blockchain technology all that sort of stuff being used for Things that's not necessarily bad or evil, but just don't kind of like push the world forward in a really, you know A grand and scalable way and these are things that i've talked about before things like the ponzi's the money games the you know The obscene wealth that people make from these sorts of things instead of you know Focusing on the actual world-changing applications and not just things like defi But things kind of like on chain identity new ways of kind of like coordinating new governance systems all that sort of stuff Obviously that stuff, you know is less interesting to people to most people than making money But I think from my reading vatalik's concerns are that We have this amazing technology that can do all this sort of stuff But we're really just focusing on using it to make money at you know Or to kind of like come up with new ways to make uh to make money new ways to make different ponzi's and money games And stuff like that and this can be used for good as well Like you guys know about the concept of regenerative finance basically using these speculative degen things For good and you know kind of bringing that funding to to you know public goods funding and stuff like that bringing that money there And you know we can also use those sorts of things to to to do things like Go put money towards humanitarian efforts obviously Ethereum on crypto in general had a really great I had a really great some initiative to kind of donate to the ukrainian kind of war effort and the old I guess like the defense Effort there where they I believe was raised over 100 million dollars So obviously that a lot of that is speculative profits that people have made and they're just kind of like donating that there So it can be used for good, but I think right now, you know the vast majority of this ecosystem is is being used to just kind of like make money right whether it's Just participating in outright scams whether it's kind of like participating in ponzi's or money games whether it's just speculating on tokens Which is fine like I mean as I said i'm not saying this is a bad thing This is a bad thing, but I think the target concerns are that you know we're wasting the technology that we have and I you know I share those concerns. I've written about this a lot in the newsletter. I've talked about it a lot on the refuel You know and it's I mean it's easy for for For people like Vitalik and I to say these sorts of things I think Vitalik's been quite consistent with his views But it's easy for people to already have the money to say these sorts of things and I totally understand that like i'm talking about This from a from a privileged position But i'm not saying that making money is bad or wanting to make money is bad or you know Maybe your only goal in this ecosystem is to make money I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but I think that we should you know find ways to essentially incentivize the I guess creation of tools that actually go beyond just making money because At the end of the day guys like making money and you know making lots of money is just one small part of Of life there are so many other things going on in life I mean, you know It doesn't matter how much money you have if you're living under a kind of like oppressive Regime and even if you're kind of like a millionaire if you're not an oligarch You know one of the kind of like top people in the inner circle You are still kind of like at the whims of of a shitty government, right or you know, I mean Yes more money can buy you better health care. But um, But at the end of the day, right? There are certain things that money aren't going to be able to cure right no matter how much you throw at it Uh, but those are kind of I guess like esoteric examples But an example that maybe relates to crypto more is it doesn't matter how much money you have if you're not putting you know If if kind of like we're building, uh, if we're not building better, you know coordination mechanisms better kind of like systems that allow for uh, The world to just kind of like get better over time to help more people to basically bring everyone up together Not just the kind of like singular people making money in crypto then it's it's definitely a waste But I highly recommend reading the kind of like entire post here in on time I think it might be paywalled for some people and it doesn't seem to be paywalled for me They they are they are bugging me to subscribe. But I mean, I don't really read Time magazine, but this uh, this story was definitely a really good one You know pills behind the curtain a bit of italics life as well So if you're interested in that definitely go check this out But I think you know, I could talk forever about these sorts of things that italics spoke about in here But um, I I don't want to fill up to you know, the whole episode today with just that Uh, but definitely give this a read and if you want to discuss this further you can in the discord channel It's a pretty good place to discuss it. So yeah, just ping me on there. We can talk about it further there All right, so some client diversity, I guess metrics and movements happening here So one thing from freddie who is the ethereum ecosystem lead at block daemon, uh, basically in a tweet He said regarding ethereum client diversity. I created some financial scenario modeling of risks benefits obviously with simplifications And only looking at large client level failures, but wanted to make the unlikely but possible disasters explicit So you can kind of see here the kind of I guess like financial modeling that freddie has done now as i've discussed as i've discussed before Depending on what client you run in the event of a kind of an attack or a bug if you're running a super majority client you get punished a lot more than running a minority client in terms of kind of like the Amount of e that you stand to lose due to slashing or something else Uh or kind of like something similar to that But in this kind of I guess uh spreadsheet freddie goes over the different scenarios of what can happen and you know The penalties that can happen here. So I thought this is really cool um, I think you know, there's there are definitely assumptions made here and kind of uh, I guess it's not going to be like 100 totally accurate But it's good that we start kind of like thinking about these sorts of things and we start modeling them out because I mean i've been harping on about client diversity for a while But I think that client diversity goes beyond just like the attack scenario that I was kind of like um, not just the attack scenario But like the scenarios that I was talking about in the in the past and it really does uh, I guess like it doesn't pay to run the super majority client in the event of one of these attacks or one of these bugs So definitely, uh, just another kind of like thing to keep in mind here But uh, yeah go check out this spreadsheet from freddie i'll link in the youtube description And the second thing I got to do with client diversity is this new website called rated.network I haven't seen this before. I don't know if it's totally new but essentially what it does is it basically ranks uh, the different kind of I guess staking services and pools and things like that and their client distribution what that kind of looks like on the the beacon chain here so you can see here that Essentially in uh, I believe in pink or in I guess like that's a hot pink there is that is prism in in in dark blue Or I guess like a purple is lighthouse in a uh aqua or turquoise is teku and then nimbus is in the orange here So obviously a lot of a lot of hot pink there right a lot of uh staking service providers using uh prism And using majority prism, uh, i've showed this before as part of another website where they broke down kind of like this distribution here of clients But I mean coinbase is still over 80 percent prism. That's pretty bad. Kraken's over 90 percent prism You know, that's that's terrible uh bit for next and hobby are at 95 percent I mean ancar is 97 percent like this is pretty bad guys and not to focus on the bad I mean, you know, there are some good things here like f2 pool was using 100 lighthouse steak fish is using 96 lighthouse Um, I mean that's better because lighthouse isn't the majority client but really all these pools and service providers They shouldn't be using um, uh, a kind of like any one client as like a majority for them I I think the ideal distribution is maybe something like what rocker pool has where they have like, uh, you know prism at 10 percent here Lightass at 44 percent take away 37 percent and nimbus at 9 percent. I would prefer to see that all 25 25 25 25 Obviously, we're probably not going to ever get to that but I mean I've just I've just I've kind of like talked about how rocker pool was killing it in the client diversity game before Um, and they really are compared to their peers But uh, you know, it's it's it's not enough to have kind of like, you know, 100 percent teku or 100 percent lighthouse or whatever Just because it's not the super majority you're better off at least having kind of like a 50 50 split or you know, 30 30 20 20 Uh, that's what I would like to see but I mean, this is me just kind of like dreaming of an ideal world I honestly don't think we're going to get to that world. I think that You know, as long as we have no one client as part of these, uh, service providers at kind of like having more than a I mean at Kind of like worst more than a 60 percent share ideally less than a 50 percent share I think we're in a pretty good place, but you know, that's going to take time, you know It's going to take time to for the exchanges like queen best and kraken to get off prism Um, you know, they may not even get off prison. They may just kind of like stop on spinning up new prism clients and just spin up other clients when people stake with them So it's probably going to take a bit, uh, you know, a lot longer there, but still, I think it's getting better I think client diversity is getting better slowly over time, but it's going to be a bit of an uphill battle And actually there's more than one page here. There's two pages here and you can see a breakdown of other other kind of, um, exchange service providers here as well But definitely go check out this website. Uh, it'll be linked in the YouTube description below All right. So a massive announcement out of optimism today, they have raised another funding round here A series B at a $150 million raise at a $1 billion, oh sorry, $1.6 billion valuation Now I'll disclose you how I participated in this round as an angel investor As I said to you guys, if I get the opportunity to participate in a round of a Ethereum scalability solution, I am definitely participating Like there's, it's a no brainer to me, just, I want to support these teams. I want to be on board with them I want to, I want to see, you know, help them in any way that I can because at the end of the day, this is Ethereum's future So, um, you know, in this blog post, they kind of like announced the raise and they, they say what they're going to be Essentially putting the money towards, you know, all the same stuff that they've been kind of like doing with, um, you know, onboarding more people Hiring more people, funding more kind of like scalability research, things like that And the valuation was actually $1.65 billion, sorry Um, and, you know, raised $150 million here, uh, and I've highlighted how they've been, you know, been growing the team recently And all the kind of like contributions that they've made to Ethereum core development as well So it's just going to be more of the same, I think from optimism, which is totally fine and good Like more of the same is really good because they've been doing excellent work for, for a while now But this is just awesome to see I mean, it's, it's awesome to see not only Ethereum scalability teams getting, you know, getting the funding But also, uh, getting it so, so quickly as well Because I can imagine that this round was probably oversubscribed and they were probably kind of like I guess investors clawing to get a kind of, kind of slice of this And I'm sure optimism will probably eventually do a series, you know, a series C or if they do a token or whatever And this isn't me having like any kind of insider information or anything like that No, I mean, I think people get the wrong idea about angel investors For pretty much all of the projects that I'm an angel investor in Like, I think, I think pretty much 100% of them I never get any kind of like, you know, quote unquote insider information or any special privilege information And nor do I ask for it because I don't, I don't want that I want to be able to kind of like just participate as a kind of like a public person as well there So I don't know if they're going to do a series C or a token or anything like that But, you know, I've said to you guys before that I think all the L2s are going to do tokens It's not news, but it's always kind of like a mix up, sorry, a toss up of whether they're going to raise another round before doing a token Not just optimism, but other kind of like projects out there Or they'll just go straight to token, we'll have to see how that plays out But $150 million is a lot of cheddar guys, it's a lot of money That's going to definitely put a dent in optimism's building here And I'm curious to see, you know, how far they go with this money And how many new people they hire as well and who they hire Because they have some rock stars on the team already And I'm curious to see, you know, who else they kind of like add to the stack there Alright, so a couple of tweets here from Pseudotheos and Polina So Pseudotheos tweeted saying EIP 4844, which is one of the EIPs that I've spoken about lately Would effectively reduce roll up fees by up to 100x even before dank sharding And in this thread they explore how this works And there's kind of like a nice little table here that shows it So essentially you can see here, you know, before EIP 4844 for just sending ETH It would cost you, I guess, let's lose optimism and arbitrum as an example 37 cents and 53 cents respectively Sopping tokens is 54 and 74 cents respectively But then after 4844, these drop dramatically It becomes like a sub 1 cent for both sending ETH and swapping tokens And this is something that I've discussed on obviously on the refuel A lot recently about how these EIPs are coming in the Shanghai update hopefully after the merge And will just dramatically reduce optimistic roll up fees here So this is really cool And I've explained how this kind of like works before It's got to do with data storage and stuff like that And this is before dank sharding, you know Once we get dank sharding, the fees are going to be basically negligible for these L2s I mean, you won't even feel them anymore And you know, people often say, well, if the fees are so kind of like low Isn't that just going to mean that Ethereum's fee revenue goes down and that, you know, the burn is going to go down? No, guys, this goes back to what I've been saying for a while now There's going to be so much demand for Ethereum layer 1 block space Even with the cheap layer 2 fees, that it's just going to outpace the cheapness It doesn't matter that it's cheap L1 is always going to be congested Even if everything moves off L1 to L2 L2 is going to fill up that block space very, very quickly Even with kind of like dank sharding And I think that's because I expect the TPS to go up, you know, immensely I mean, let me put it to you this way Right now with, you know, 50 cent transaction fees on layer 2s A lot of things still aren't economical to do Microtransactions, right, aren't economical to do Streaming payments may not even be totally economical to do Especially in a microtransaction sense Decentralized social media, like All On Chain and kind of like some of the NFT stuff You know what I'm talking about, right? It's not really that economically feasible Drop fees down to a tenth of a cent A twentieth of a cent, a fiftieth of a cent These things start becoming very, very economical And then they are going to induce that demand, right? By having the fees that cheap Which essentially means that it's going to make up for the I guess it's going to be kind of like a quantity of fees Rather than kind of like a small number of transactions Having a lot of, providing a lot of fee revenue It's going to be a large number of transactions Providing a lot of small fee revenue But that adds up over time So it's kind of like inverting what we currently have today So very, very cool to see some numbers put to it here from Pseudotheos And then Polina quote tweeted and said, you know, some clarifications For this, for Pseudotheos thread where they say L1 call data can be up to 930 kilobytes per block 10 kilobytes is not the limit It may be 10 kilobytes now because that's all the demand there is now And EIP 4844 introduces a dedicated space for raw data Though it can be any non-state sequential data And then there's a bunch of other kind of like things in this thread from Polina as well This, I mean, you know, it's funny like I'm finding it hard to keep up with this stuff lately to be honest This stuff is getting like super awesome Like it's actually really crazy to see like how clued in Polina People like Polina and Pseudotheos are and I read these threads And I still learn something new from this every day So that's why I love I think for me in this ecosystem from where I am right now If someone's able to teach me something new at this point of like, you know Since I cover this space every day And since I basically have been in this space for so long If someone is able to teach me something new And something super interesting that's really, that's also new Then, you know, I'm going to follow these people instantly and promote them And I've been talking about Polina and Pseudotheos a lot recently on the refuel They're definitely both highly recommended followers You're going to learn so much from them from following them They really are putting out so much great content And, you know, just look at these threads You know, as I've been saying a lot lately The rest of the crypto ecosystem is at least At least six months behind the Ethereum roadmap Or kind of like what's happening in Ethereum But, you know, this sort of stuff is kind of, you know, probably Nine to twelve months away from happening at this stage, right? If it even happens in the Shanghai update And people are really behind on this They have no idea this is coming, right? So just paying attention to this sort of stuff Just realizing that it's coming I know it's kind of sometimes hard to deal with all the fight around You know, Ethereum has high gas fees Oh, L2 fees are still too high blah blah blah Guys, as I said before, L2 fees are coming down over time Once these upgrades go into L1 to enable these L2 fees to come down It's going to be so totally negligible And people aren't going to know what to do with all the block space that we give them All the cheap fees that we give them So very much looking forward to that And I guess thanks to Polyneo and Pseudo Theos for putting together these threads today And there's one other thing that I wanted to talk about with regards to Ethereum's Kind of longer-term roadmap And this is a thread that, I think they say his name Julián Ballet or Ballet started here He's a Geth Core developer But basically this is a series of threads to highlight some of the changes That come with stateless Ethereum and Verkle trees And today he's going to talk about changes to the block format So this is technical of course And stateless Ethereum and Verkle trees is on the longer-term Ethereum roadmap It is not something that's going to happen overnight It's not something that's happening in the Shanghai update or anything like that either But it is very important for Ethereum It is going to enable more scalability A healthier, more sustainable Ethereum chain And it's definitely very good to keep on top of this And as I said, like, you know, most people are six months behind Ethereum A lot of people are one year behind Ethereum This is probably at least two years from being implemented, I would say So if you're paying attention to this today, you really are at the absolute bleeding edge Of Ethereum development So I recommend paying attention to it Realizing what's going on in the stateless Ethereum and Verkle trees A kind of arena there Because that is also a massive boost to Ethereum scalability As well as the sustainability and, you know, and kind of like ease of running a node Going forward and into kind of like the far future as well Which is what it's all about, right? So definitely give this thread a read I'll link it in the YouTube description below All right, so another chapter or another first cut of the chapter Of Ben Edgington's Upgrading Ethereum book has been done So this is on BLS signatures And you've probably heard about BLS signatures a lot recently In the context of proof of stake In the context of, you know, layer two stuff All that kind of like stuff there Well, if you want a complete breakdown of what they are and how they work This is the chapter for you I actually, like, just as an aside here This book from Ben is incredible, freaking incredible Like, it's not finished yet It's kind of like, you know, obviously still in development But like look at all the chapters he's got here that have been done so far This chapter is on shuffling This is not just kind of like a high level overview guys This is deep in the weeds, technical stuff If you want to know everything there is to know about Ethereum The Ethereum beacon chain, Ethereum proof of stake And kind of like all that sort of stuff And just like into the deepest technical weeds you can get The deepest technical weeds you can go I mean, this is what you read This is what you have to read I mean, like, look at this stuff This is crazy Like, it's all so well documented as well I've read a few of these chapters Like, a lot of it obviously goes over my head Because a lot of it is technical But I'm still getting a lot of useful stuff out of this And it's just incredible that Ben is able to put this together He's one of the hardest working people, right He not only is putting this together But he does the Watch New in ETH 2 newsletter He also works on the Teccu client The beacon chain client there He's just all across this I mean, it's just incredible Like, I always, I guess, respect Really, really, really respect people like this Who are able to kind of like put together such high quality work And so effectively as well and so consistently I just had to kind of like gush a little bit there But, you know, that kind of like chapter that I was talking about on BLS signatures You should definitely go read if you are interested in kind of, I guess, Learning more about it And kind of like learning how it all works under the hood It is quite a lengthy read here from what I can see But it will explain to you how it all works Why it was chosen You know, how it helps the beacon chain You know, why it's good All that sort of stuff there And, you know, definitely go give this a read I'll link it in the YouTube description for you So, all right, someone showed me this in the Discord channel today Something called Orbis Which is building itself as a Web3 social network And they put out a tweet I believe this was from three days ago Where they said Remember block scan chat from Etherscan I covered this on the review when it first came out We built the same thing but decentralized and encrypted with no transaction fees You can now DM any Ethereum address or ENS name with Orbis Users will see your messages when they join And then you can have like more There's a bunch of more details here Now I remember when Etherscan brought out their block scan chat I did say that Well, I'm pretty sure that I said that I wish that it was decentralized and I wish that it was open source Well, this is claiming to be decentralized It's built on the ceramic network and encrypted with LIT protocol here It is using a bunch of other infrastructure in the background as well That we're all kind of like used to here And you can go visit this at orbis.club So this is really cool I mean, I think decentralized messaging and kind of like using the blockchain To do a lot of different things rather than financial transactions Doing kind of like the quote-unquote Web3 stuff Something that we're going to see a lot more of going forward Especially because NFTs have taken off as well And you can incorporate NFTs with this sort of stuff very easily It's all composable It's all interoperable And doing it in decentralized ways No small feat guys I know that Status has been building a decentralized messenger for a very long time now Since 2017 basically And it hasn't really taken off yet I think they were too early But as I said, I think we're getting to a point now where this stuff matters more and more Especially given the stuff happening in the background with censorship And you know, governments shutting down parts of the internet and blocking things Like we really do need these decentralized tools more than ever Because I think that as time goes on governments Look, I think maybe not in our Western bubble But I think a lot of governments around the world are definitely going to get more oppressive As time goes on Especially around the internet and trying to control the internet Some of them will try to control crypto and fail But as long as we have these tools that work with the internet I think this is how you kind of like protect yourself from that Or at least arm yourself against that Because at the end of the day, these sorts of things are the modern weapons, right? Like obviously as hunter-gatherers, we had physical weapons That's how we started You know, we crafted kind of like sticks and stones and things like that And we basically defended ourselves with that But in the modern era, you know, you still defend yourself physically with weapons, right? But I mean most people have no use for that Most people are protected by the police or by kind of like their nation's army But then, you know, there are instances where that starts to break down and stuff like that But for most people most of the time in Western nations, you don't ever need the police I don't remember the last time I called the police I don't remember whenever I needed the army Obviously, it's there to protect the nation But me as a person, protecting my own personal safety You know, I have to do this online too Like there is a world where maybe the Australian government says You know, this app is banned, this app is banned There are actually been... The Australian government unfortunately has actually been pretty strict against encryption And been trying to, I guess like, not kill... Maybe not kill encryption, but like or encrypted messaging But try to put in backdoors and get around it And that's why we need this sort of stuff more than ever, I believe Because you may think you're relatively safe with your Western government But I think even the Western governments are kind of like, you know Being much more aggressive than I thought they would be at this stage But yeah, cool to see this from Orbis Club here You can kind of like see, you know, if you go to orbis.club Hey, someone's talked about me Anthony Sano, Retated Death Rate, about it Will we hear about it featured on the Daily Wear Refill tonight? Well, yes guys, you do, you are I haven't connected my wallet to this yet I won't do it on live on the stream here But this is pretty cool Like, I like this This was the person, Adam Dawson, who shared it in the Discord channel there Well, there you go, I covered it on the Refill for you And I gave my kind of like view on why I think it's important But as I said, there are plenty of these tools coming out Plenty of them coming to market They're all going to be doing their own kind of like thing And trying to essentially kind of like put their own spin on it So we're gonna have to see how that all shakes out And I'm very curious to see what the future of these kind of like protocols look like Going forward Alright, so finally we have an update here from Quentar They announced today that their futures beta on Optimism mainnet is finally here You can now trade ETH, BTC and LINK per contracts with up to 10x leverage completely on chain at v2.beta.quentar.io Now this is built on synthetics using Chainlink oracles as well Yeah, this has been a long time coming I remember when Quentar spun out of synthetics It was quite a while ago now, but yeah, it's finally live As I said yesterday, I think I said yesterday on the Refill and also wrote about it There is a DeFi Renaissance brewing guys Like they have been building for so long There is the layer 2 stuff that is going to enable DeFi to go to the next level There are so many kind of like innovations happening Not the quote unquote DeFi 2.0 innovations that was just kind of like mostly Ponzi stuff But actual innovations happening Especially given that L2 enables new things to be able to be built Obviously lowers fees, will onboard new users during the kind of like next leg up And as I mentioned yesterday, I actually feel like ETH I don't want to jinx it, but I really do feel like ETH is ready to run again Especially coming up to the merge And that's going to bring in so many new people into the Ethereum ecosystem And layer 2s are ready for them now guys Like yes, the fees aren't as cheap as they're going to be But they're cheap, they're much cheaper than main net And they're getting cheaper over time as well And there's more of an ecosystem on there too I mean, Aave is now live on there, right? So pretty much most things that people want to do on Ethereum layer 1 They can now do on Optimism, Arbitrum or even the Polygon POS chain And I think that's going to be Especially being able to withdraw to these things from centralized exchanges I think that's going to be very, very awesome to see How this plays out with a new wave of new users coming in And beginning to experience layer 2 Ethereum Rather than having to be stuck on layer 1 Ethereum And then we all hear them go on about the gas fees being kind of like high And how Ethereum is a scam and kind of like bleeding them dry And all that sort of stuff, right? So I'm personally looking forward to that most going forward, right? And kind of like over the next, I guess, 6 or 12 months Or even just like the remainder of this year We're already like halfway through March, guys It's actually quite insane But yeah, so very cool to see this Definitely go check out Quinter if you haven't already You can go in the blog post here and go visit at v2.beta.quinter.io All right, last few minutes of the refill today Just wanted to quickly remind you guys That I'm going to be at Blockchain Week next week I am flying up to Sydney on the Monday night So I'm going to try and record the refill on the Monday During the day, do the newsletter and all that sort of stuff I'm going to be at the Sydney event on Tuesday all day I hope to see many of you there Then I'm flying back to Melbourne Wednesday morning And I'll be at the Melbourne event all day as well And I think Tuesday, Wednesday, I'm pretty sure there's not going to be a refill So I'm just warning you guys If you don't see a refill on Tuesday or Wednesday It's because I've been at the conference I mean, I'm going to the after parties too So there's like a near 0% chance Because I'll try but I don't think it's going to happen Just kind of like warning you there But Monday definitely there will be one And of course on the remainder of Thursday, Friday as well I think Thursday's episode I'm probably just going to use that Like at least probably half of that To cover everything from the Tuesday and Wednesday as well Just to give you guys my view on it How everything went What I kind of learned and what I kind of gleaned from it But yeah, as I said, hope to see lots of you guys there I know that tickets are like absolutely oversold I think they're like five times oversold So unfortunately a lot of you won't be able to come to the physical events I hope you watch both of my talks I'm doing one with Mehdi from Sigma Prime I'll be doing that in Sydney on Tuesday morning You can find the full schedule on the Blockchain Week website And then Wednesday to close out the day on Melbourne I'm actually interviewing Kane from Synthetix And that's going to be cool as well So very much looking forward to all of that And yeah, I think that's going to be it for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching Be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet Give it a thumbs up Subscribe to the newsletter Join the Discord channel And I'll catch you all next week Thanks everyone

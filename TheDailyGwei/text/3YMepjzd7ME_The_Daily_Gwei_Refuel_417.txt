 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily way refuel where we kept the latest news in the etherium ecosystem I'm your host dantheny sasano and today the 29th of july 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So kane warwick from synthetics today put out this interesting tweet I was quote tweeting evan van ness here and kane says, you know I would swap eip 1559 for eip 48 44 in a second. It is more important than 1559 It nukes every alt alt l1 into oblivion. We need more awareness and momentum around this to avoid a multi-year Implementation process like we had with eip 1559 and then tim biker replied But I want to kind of give some context around these of people who may not be aware So 48 44 is proto dank sharding for those who kind of like don't remember that There's a whole website dedicated to it You can go check that out if you just search like eip 48 44 on Google the website should come up And eip 1559, you know, we obviously all know and love that eip there now Kane referenced here kind of like this multi-year implementation process that we had to go through for eip 1559 and not wanting to repeat the kind of like process for eip 48 44 and I'm in total agreement with him I mean, I'm not in agreement with him about swapping the EIPs around but that's like a semantic issue like stopping It would take just yeah, I mean, it's just it's kind of like not not something that would happen But it's kind of like funny how he framed it I think he was doing that to kind of get some kind of action on this tweet get some Get some awareness around this tweet But basically the reason why one five five nine took so long at least a major reason and probably the main reason Was because it sat in limbo for a while now for those of you who don't know it took about two and a half years from when a IP one five five nine was drafted as an EIP to when it went into the network and I Would say that at least the year of that time was wasted It was wasted because there was no one coordinating the effort for one five five nine No one really knew what was happening on the development side of things And it didn't really have anyone kind of like monitoring the work on it And then I think probably even more than a year at least a year into one five five nines EIP being kind of like in draft stage if not 18 months Tim biker came along and basically said hey I'm gonna coordinate this thing We need to get this thing built implemented and that's when I would say the real work started I I think before that it was there was some research going on there was some development going on But it really was stuck in limbo for a long time and also the resources weren't there either because it was a bear market And it just yeah, you know the people resources weren't there the money wasn't there money was tighter and all that stuff as well So that I think is the main reason um Now in terms of like not letting us fall into the same trap for 48 44 I don't think we can because we have the coordination now caught the ethereum core development is in the best place it's ever been in as I've mentioned before and As Tim biker replied to Kane here He said you know for 48 44 the big the biggest bottleneck right now is probably engineers And they have a call tomorrow to discuss the progress or I think today to discuss the progress And optimism and coinbase are the two teams who are helping push out the code here along with all the kzg folks as well And then Tim continues by saying and to go even further I think for the next two to three people each extra full-time engineer on this with the right background client client code DevOps node running and testing for the next six months meaningful increases the odds is ready for the next hard fork which Would be cute to each next year So I guess yeah like 12 months from all this and 12 months from now depending on when in q2 kind of like you point to But 48 44 has been worked on for a while already It's been obviously in research phase And there's been kind of like test nets and definite spun up and it is really high as a priority for everyone in the etherium core core development ecosystem because we know how Important it is for layer twos to be able to kind of collapse their costs in order to compete with these Alternative layer ones out there that may be offering those cheaper fees and I've discussed 48 44 or proto Dan charting in detail before so I'm not going to go over that there But yeah, I really do think it's not going to be stuck in development How it's not going to take us a long time to get this implemented I feel like once the merge is done Basically all the focus is going to shift to that and and beacon chain withdrawals They're the two major things that need to basically happen in the next I guess like six to twelve months after the merge And as I've said before there may be separate hard forks It may just be like a standalone beacon chain withdrawal hard fork Maybe six months after the merge then we do the proto dank charting and other six months after the merge But they definitely have to happen both have to happen as soon as possible For completely different reasons, but still both are very very important So just wanted to give some kind of like color around that because I know a lot of people would have seen canes tweet today But he is right. We do need to get this shipped We do need to get these layer to cost down kind of like to as cheaply as possible I can talk it's already really cheap right like especially at a layer one gas prices as they are today But if we can get them to sub sent transaction kind of fees are for something like a swap on a layer two In the next six or twelve months that would be a huge win for aetherium And that would kill a lot of the old tail one kind of fun. I guess like momentum I think a lot of it's been killed already I think a lot of the momentum came to all tail ones due to liquidity mining incentives Which only really work in a bull market, and I've seen the communities around these all tail ones I say communities lightly here. They're not really communities, but I've seen pretty much all the social kind of I guess some What's your head away? How do I put this the kind of like social signals around them basically evaporate since the prices went down? So I do think we've got time, but at the same time we shouldn't base Upgrades for aetherium based on kind of like market Market dynamics or anything like that they never have been based on that so once the merge is done I hope that we can keep pushing towards 48 44 at full steam ahead And I think we will I don't think it's going to be held up like one five five nine was it's definitely not going to fall In development into a development hell with the amount of people that are involved with it and people that want it And you know we've won five five nine It was a different thing a lot of people viewed one five five nine as a thing that just to pump eighth like for bet For if it was right or wrong. It doesn't matter. That's what they viewed it as whereas 48 44 You can't argue that it's going to pump beef because it's got nothing to do with but with eight right It's got to do with making sure that we can scale layer one aetherium Enough so that layer twos can get the really cheap transaction fees there, so yeah cool to say this I guess like put we put out by cane to raise awareness around this and great to see Tim biker replying here All right another core development news I think I spoke about this academic grants round that the if you're in foundation was doing a little while ago Well the grantees were just announced for this so Danny Ryan shared this blog post on Twitter Where he said where it's titled academic grants round grantee announcement And you can kind of like see the breakdown of where more than two million dollars has gone It's been allocated to across 39 grants in seven different categories are spanning from economics to p2p networking to form verification And here's a breakdown of everyone that's going to be working on This and and a lot of them a lot of PhDs here It was a little bit like Cardano reading this list But they're gonna be doing a lot of research here on Across basically all of these categories, and I mean you can get a breakdown of this if you go look at the blog post yourself But this is awesome I mean the fact that the Ethereum Foundation has so much capital in our to deploy to things like this is great I mean, I know there's a mean that they sell the top On eighth they kind of did some good trades during the bull market But I think they have hundreds of millions of dollars sitting not sitting there But like you know that they're gonna be able to put the work in fiat But they've also got obviously their eighth bat eighth bags that they haven't haven't sold all of it They still got it there, but they're very very well capitalized right now They're putting that capital to use which is very very awesome to see and it's not just to use on the core development side It's also to use on the research side which is something that definitely is probably underfunded at this point But it's getting more funding so if you want to see a breakdown of this you can I'll link it this blog post in the YouTube description below for you to check out Alright, so swell networks main net release candidate is now alive This means that swell network is only one step away from main net go live So this is obviously on test net as a main net release candidate Which means that this will be the candidate that goes to main net so that that that's why they're only one step away Yeah, now just a reminder for people out there swell is a new liquid staking provider Kind of similar to a rocker pool or a lido Obviously how you've all heard about that before But yeah great to see that they're kind of like at their last stage before they were able to hit main net here I mean I spoke with yesterday, so I'm not gonna rehash it now, but more competition It's gonna lead to a better more healthier and more diverse staking ecosystem And it's just gonna lead to more competition between the existing kind of like staking providers out there and lead to them Kind of like because of that more competition being more more. I guess like What's the word? I'm looking for I guess like they're gonna be quicker in how they release things and how they kind of like do things and come To market with things and we already saw this kind of play out with lido's dominance going up so quickly It really did spur on Rockerpool to act and they and they did they acted quite quickly and they've got a bunch of things coming as I spoken out before But they even acted on the marketing front with with kind of like bankless Which I thought was was really good as well So yeah cool to see that swells main net release candidate is live on is now live And they're only one step away from main net All right, so just this tweet here that I came across today from an account on Twitter are called drop knowledge Yeah, where he said taught my mom about zero knowledge proofs today the use case She came up with was quote so a real estate agent could simply check if my net worth met their qualifications But I wouldn't have to reveal the actual amount to them end quote and then he and they go on and say hell yeah Mom, this is a very very simple kind of explanation of how zero knowledge proofs work But I think it's really relatable because I mean zkp zero knowledge stuff like it's talked about all the time But he's definitely still very confusing for a lot of people, but this very simple example here I think clicks for a lot of people and the tweet was very popular as you can see on the engagement here, but basically You know the fact that we can prove that something is true without having to reveal What it is is incredibly powerful, and I've talked about this before there's so many use cases for this There's so many things that we haven't even thought of yet, and there's gonna be so many developments on this front as well So very excited to obviously keep on top of that But I think this is just a great way to explain to people how zero knowledge proofs I can be applied you know practically rather than just like theoretically and especially I guess in the crypto context There are ways to kind of like show this as well and use a crypto thing so you could say you know so You not just a real estate agent But like an exchange for example could check if your net worth met their qualifications for one of their I guess like Exchange accounts like one of their premium exchange accounts And you wouldn't have to reveal the actual amount to them like that I mean it extends to every use case you can think of it doesn't have to be just a real estate agent right so So yeah, I thought this was just a really easy way to understand kind of like the practical uses of zero knowledge proofs All right so Stephen Goldfeder one of the co-founders of off-chain labs here that develop arbitrum has put together a thread Titled titled I guess like the first tweet starts off by saying some scattered thoughts on arbitrum nitro zk roll-ups and plumbing now This is not this is not plumbing like the physical plumbing the water water plumbing. This is kind of like infrastructure plumbing But essentially this thread I highly recommend giving it a read But what this thread is is basically Stephen giving his kind of thoughts on how he believes arbitrum nitro is Still the best solution out there right now to scale aetherium and The reason why they kind of like went with arbitrum avm to start with is because that was the best at the time now nitro Is the best so they kind of like getting rid of the avm and then he also says that When zk proofs and when's kind of like zk take gets to a point? Where he thinks it's better than the current optimistic roll-up tech then he's completely open to making Arbitrum into something more zk like right and I've said this since basically the beginning that I've that I've been talking about Optimistic roll-ups on the refuel these optimistic wall up teams aren't just going to sit there and be like okay Well, you know this zk tech works, and it's better than our optimistic roll-ups. We're just gonna keep doing our optimistic wall up stuff No, they're gonna Do what's best today and what works today to give people something practical to use today? And then as things evolve as the tech matures more they're gonna adopt it and look there are Teams that are just kind of going straight into zk proof straight straight into kind of like zero knowledge roll-ups And that's all fine and dandy, but no zero knowledge roll up. There's no zk vl main net right There's no zero knowledge roll up that comes kind of like close to the activity of optimism and arbitrum There's no generalized zk roll-up that does that there obviously is zk roll-ups out there that I have some traction Like dy dx and and loop ring, but they're not the they're not equivalent to what option I'll to miss my in terms of like generalized kind of Evm equivalent compatible Smart contracting that you can do on there there. They're limited they have their own limitations, right? So I highly recommend giving this rate at this thread of rate from Steven It does hit home on that point that I've been trying to hit home on in that in the fact that optimistic roll-ups are not Obsolete they're still very very good technology They still work very well, and if they do end up becoming obsolete and getting superseded by zk technology Well, then arbitrum and optimism can both adopt this and it actually shouldn't be hard for them to do this either Like I feel like they've been preparing already And they kind of like looking into ways to do it if they were to do it And I feel like it's not going to be a difficult thing for them to do so maybe it will require like a lot of Coordination, but I don't think they're going to have to do a regenesis or anything like that in order to do it So that would be cool as well, but yeah definitely recommend giving this thread a raid. I'll link it in the YouTube description below As you're speaking of arbitrum is also this thread here on updates of the arbitrum of rinkaby migration Which is kind of on I guess upgrading the arbitrum rinkaby to nitro I'm sorry I had my my lost my words there a little bit and as you guys know you know this was done I think this is all done successfully you can you can see here the albertram rinkaby migration tonight I said successfully being completed as a 15 hours ago, and the explorer is also up as well So this is just running through the test net motions, and then we can expect main net in about two to three weeks I would say from from today Which is very exciting of course and then I wonder how long it'll be before they turn the odyssey event back on Well, they do it at the same time like would you imagine them doing you know the nitro upgrade and then basically? Within the same day saying hey odyssey is turned back on go wild right maybe they won't maybe they'll wait a couple of days Just to see if everything went well with the upgrade then turn odyssey back on but either way I don't imagine them waiting very long to do it because odyssey was Honestly like it was leading to a lot of usage of the albertram chain there were a lot of people on boarding There was a lot of excitement around it Obviously totally understand why they had to pause it because of the fact that the network was getting congested and nitro wasn't live yet And they were really focused on nitro instead of kind of like trying to Band-aid fix the the current kind of like network or bet or do some kind of solution to to scale it up But only in like a short-term solution So yeah that was paused obviously I covered that on the refill a few weeks ago And I'm sure it'll be restarted in the next few weeks at once nitro is live so great to see that the rink of your Migration went through successfully you can check out the block explorer if you want to here as well It's linked in this little thread. I'll link that in the description below for you All right, so speaking of optimistic roll-ups. There was an interesting announcement from Synapse protocol here Synapse protocol I'm not pronouncing that right either way, but I'll just say synapse protocol here. They've introduced something called Synapse chain now I read this on Twitter, and I was like oh God here. We go another kind of like Another cosmos chain right that you guys know my views on them I'm not going to rehash that but it's not it's actually an optimistic roll-up so in this blog post they basically detail What what it is? I'm still not confused But I'm still kind of like not I don't have a total understanding of like exactly what this is because they do call it a sovereign execution environment, but the thing is is that I think they're using the term sovereign wrong because There are such things as kind of like sovereign roll-ups But they're not true up like it's not a true optimistic roll-up because it could it has its data somewhere else But has a settlement on aetherium right so those things do exist But the thing is is that if you're a sovereign roll-up Then you're not kind of like a full true optimistic roll-up for example right because you're storing your data elsewhere You're not storing it on aetherium, but if you read in the blog post they do say that They're going to be storing the data and settling on aetherium, so yeah It just kind of like confused me a little bit I'm still waiting for smarter people to kind of like dig into this and and kind of see what happens here But essentially what they want what they're wanting synapse chain to be here is an execution environment for for bridging between so basically the way I understand that is that there'll be an optimistic roll-up that basically acts as a Hub of liquidity and then everything can basically plug into this and and essentially use that liquidity in there so For example, I think this is one use case if you're on arbitrum and use the synapse bridge And you say hey, I'm on arbitrum on liquidity CR But I want to use an app on optimism Well, then you can use this bridge as the kind of like execution environment to do that And that's my understanding of it, and they detail all this in the blog post which I'll link in the YouTube description below But yeah, I'm still digesting this it seems like they've kind of Come up with something new here rather than just like a strict optimistic roll-up It seems like a bit of a hybrid and it doesn't and I have to Really kind of like dig deeper into this to know exactly you know where the security lies and where the weakest link lies and stuff Like that, but it is very very cool to see People experimenting with obviously optimistic wall up technology and layer 2 technology in general beyond what we've seen in the past like I think this Is the first kind of like layer 2 chain or kind of like roll-up chain? That's focused on the bridging side of things obviously the roll-ups themselves have Kind of like bridging between them. I'm sorry bridges into them. They're official bridges obviously There are things like hot protocol and connects, but hop isn't its own dedicated chain right like neither is connects And it's in apps chain coming out with this basically kind of like Puts a spin on on the bridging that we're used to which I think is cool, but it's not just bridging as well They also say they're a generic cross-chain messaging system, and I've spoken about these before that was the stock where d amm And Rari's Nova thing I don't know if Ravi's no good thing is gonna go anywhere Rari kind of fell apart I believe and then you also have stock where's d amm Which I haven't really heard much about But the the thing is is that like the technology store remains like people can still build this thing and arbitrary generic cross-chain Messaging would allow for what I just mentioned that basically being able to I don't know say you want to trade You're an arbiter, and you want to trade in a liquidity pool. That's an optimism Well you could execute that trade using synapse chain for example And that would pass the message to optimism and then do it all in the background And then and then send the kind of a result back to you on on arbitrum right so Like if that is what this is and kind of like they've basically made it so that it's very seamless for the end-user This is a big deal, but as I said, I'm still kind of like digging into this I'm still talking to people about it still trying to get to the the bottom of how it all works And how security is but this is very very cool. I'll keep you guys updated on you know the more I come across kind of like the more answers I come across here, but you should give this blog post to read for yourself as well to check out what they've created There's a lot of detail here, but you know I me I'm forever the skeptic of detail that comes from the official team I definitely obviously like talking to third parties about it because the Official team is always gonna sugarcoat anything bad with there any trade-offs with it, right? They're not gonna give you like the full nitty-gritty ugliness of it They're not gonna show you exactly how the sausage is made right at least most of the teams weren't that's not necessarily a bad thing Obviously you want to kind of showcase your product you want to showcase the power of it but I definitely want to see some third parties look into this and kind of like give a Kind of um an idea of what this kind of what this actually is and where to fit where it fits in in the layer 2 spectrum All right, so speaking of layer twos. They're his mutable announced early access today for the GameStop NFT partnership They have so there's an early access immutable X layer 2 integration for the GameStop wallet So if you're interested in participating in these early access you can check out this blog post here It has a guide on how to do it. It's very simple You just basically set up your immutable X key you kind of like deposit in and it's seen with your GameStop All and it seems like it's it's all well and good and all works perfectly there So cool to see that there's an early access here It's it's funny because GameStop is doing NFT stuff on both loop ring and immutable X and I'm wondering like I'm wondering if that fragments things like I'm a fan of both immutable X and loop ring But I do want a long term what that looks like does you know one chain get more uses than another? How much kind of like effort does GameStop put into loop ring versus immutable X or vice versa, right? So that's something that I'm very curious about I'm obviously still really happy to see GameStop kind of doing these sorts of stuff with these leading L2 providers But I always get a bit weary about the I guess maybe splitting of resources for these teams because GameStop obviously is a big company or all that sort of stuff, but I doubt they have like a huge Blockchain team right and they also kind of like working with these partners so that in these partners are going to expect Like some sort of I mean a certain amount of attention a certain amount of kind of like work being put towards their own solution So I'm just wondering what the long-term kind of like play is here, and I don't know honestly I don't know which is gonna kind of win out, but I don't imagine there being too long-term it had it just just from kind of like the virtue of the fact of the attention the awareness the development the Network effect we're gonna have to see right and and I think that's true for a lot of things in crypto is like people get Excited because they're like oh, you know this is supporting this this and this and it's like okay Well, it's kind of like fragmenting like we're gonna have to kind of console it consolidate over the long term Which I think it happens just naturally anyway, especially during the the bear market we debt we So it's kind of like in the bull market you have like an expansion right you have this massive explosion of everything happening and everything Seems like it's going well because it's a bull market and then you have the bear market where there's a massive contraction and things blow up we've seen so many things blow up over the last six months and The things that kind of like stick around and make it to the next bull market are the ones that actually have tangible real value And and that people actually interested in using There are some that stick around because they just raise a lot of money in the bull market And they're kind of like what I like to call zombie projects where they're surviving on that money But in reality they don't really have a user base, so yeah, it happens across the entire industry But just in terms of kind of like GameStop's approach here I'm curious to see You know long term if both of these things succeed if both immutable X and loop ring succeed with game stop working on both of them or if it's One of those that aim eventually win out All right, so argent has put together a thread about zk sync 2.0 today And apparently over 250 dapps are building for zk sync 2.0 launch with many in stealth And they say now is the perfect time to learn all about it And why zk sync 2.0 will be a game changer for a crypto adoption you can read this thread I'll link in the description below obviously not going to read it through on the refuel but 2050 apps I Doubt that number only because that's a lot right I'm wondering like how many of those apps are actually things that people want to use as well And apparently there's many in stealth too, which is which is cool we'll have to see like I think that it's funny because There is kind of like this Handful of big apps on every chain And then there's like a long tail of apps on the kind of like each chain you basically have a popular Amm right which usually a fork of uniswap and then you have like a popular money market You may have some derivative protocols you may have some options protocols But really the two biggest ones are always the amm and and the money market really and maybe a stable coin And that may be an amm for just stable coins right but and then there's kind of like the long tail of apps where? It's kind of hard to know which of these actually has value because a lot of the time Maybe the tokens going up and they have some liquidity mining program people pile in and maybe it lasts a couple of months So maybe it lasts six months, but then eventually they kind of pile out So it's very hard to know especially in bull markets Which ones are going to be the ones that stick around and which ones aren't? But I think as time goes on as we kind of develop more and more of these apps as we kind of come to come To see which ones work which ones don't which ones have staying power I think you know we can very easily say amm's and money markets the two with the most staying power You want to you can put stable coins in there actually consider stable coins to be an application Obviously stable coins are always going to be popular no matter where they are again though It's hard to tell which stable coins are going to stay around like I mean look at ust Everyone thought ust was going to be this huge stable coin was going to be around forever It's going to kill everything and it killed itself in the end And and and obviously die has been around for a while We have confidence in die usDC and usDt we also have confidence in maybe even be usD But stable coins just as a general thing Definitely something that that kind of like is popular on any chain like I'm talking layer twos layer one side chains Whatever you want to call it there There is a dominant path there, so there was obviously going to be a bunch of those on zk sync 2.0 But I'm wondering what those long tail apps are are they just kind of like useless things are a lot of them Just nft projects We'll have to wait and see but I recommend giving this thread a rate from argent regardless And I'm curious to see which what these apps are when zk sync 2.0. Goes live Alright, so another preview of upcoming Rainbow features today So apparently they're adding a profiles kind of I guess like feature here and you can see here a screenshot of this or I guess like basically a graphic of the different kind of profile things and Ped here gives a description of being able to register an ens dot eth name directly within Rainbow create a profile by setting ens records view your profile Which looks so good apparently according to ped view other profiles and search for the eth names and their expiry day And you can see in the screenshots here what it basically looks like the funny thing is is that I feel like at this point In time there's like a handful of these wallets and and portfolio trackers that are really like competing to be your one-stop shop for I guess like all your on-chain activities with this rainbow the zappa the zero on There's argent. There's a few others out there and I zappa have as their mobile app as well, and I like I think they're doing more there They want to do like a wallet and stuff too But yeah, it feels like there's really a race here, and I just noticed I'm in the create your ens profile screenshot here That's that's fun um but yeah, it really feels like there's a race here to Normify the I guess like wallet experience. Which is what we need at the end of the day We need to make wallets fun. We need to make them more versatile We need to make them really easy to use and we need to make it so that people can have access to everything within them Right like obviously their nFTs and and the government stuff They're doing and kind of like exploring new stuff like what what zappa has done with zappa v2 So I'm really excited about this because as you guys know and as I've talked about before wallets are the front door for the on-chain Ecosystem that's never going to change like I mean okay Never going to change in terms of the fact that like a wallet is what we use right well It is kind of like what we're all or what we're all used to and the wallet can be made to do whatever you want it To do but in terms of accessing these products there are also other ways where you can have centralized kind of like businesses sitting on top and Using the underlying protocols and all that sorts of stuff and building interfaces similar to this but being custodial But in terms like a non custodial fully fledged if you're an ecosystem experience I think rainbow and zappa are really the leaders at this point in time in terms of kind of like what I've seen Arjun is definitely a leader as well, and they're they're they're a pioneer on the layer two side And they're obviously trying to do different things with social covering things like that, but in terms of beautifying the experience Rainbow and zappa seem to be at the forefront. Maybe I'm missing some others out there. Please let me know if I am But yeah, I just love the designs that they have and you guys know I'm not really a mobile wallet user So I mean I do have rainbow installed and I do play around with it But I just I don't really use it because I don't use mobile for a lot of things But I'm a heavy heavy zappa user like I use it pretty much every day So yeah, I mean I think that most people in Ethereum that like a regular on-chain users would use one of one of these things whether it be rainbow zappa zero on Arjun whatever it is But I think as I was saying before it's gonna consolidate eventually into the best product into the best applications out there And I think the race is getting tighter and tighter as as time goes on All right, so this new I guess like Twitter account not I don't know if this is a new Twitter account I hadn't heard of it before but I think it's gonna be a great opportunity to do that This is a new Twitter account I hadn't heard of it before but this Twitter account called swipe has announced today that if you're a Dow Or part of a Dow you'll be able to connect your NOSIS safe wallets directly to an if the FDIC insured bank account That's really cool. I'm that basically is blending the web 2 and web 3 worlds together right connecting a Dow Can I sorry connecting your NOSIS safe wallet to an FDIC insured bank account now FDIC is kind of I? Don't know if it's an insurance company or something in the US But it's I think coinbase uses this as well. I'm just gonna quickly look it up federal accidental federal deposit insurance corporation Yeah, I've got I've got no idea what it is I'm not in the US so I don't know but essentially it just provides insurance for The full kind of like funds here And you can see the interface here basically connecting you and you're kind of like NOSIS safe wallet to this And I think this is what swipe enables. I hadn't heard a swipe before I think they've been around for a little while here But basically this is what swipe enables. Just always was pretty cool I think that's pretty cool because it's also non-custodial as well obviously the bank account isn't non-custodial But the the NOSIS safe wallets are and being able to kind of use that within this context is is pretty cool And it's pretty cool to see the world's being blended together here, so you can check this out I'll link in the description below running out of time here. Just the last couple of things to get through So spruce put out a tweet today saying as mentioned previously We're researching how developers get started when building dapps To learn more about how we can best support sign in with a theorem development If you are a developer and have three to five minutes, we'd love to hear your feedback So if you are a developer you have some time just go to this general survey here and kind of like fill it out And give spruce your feedback. I think it'd be very valuable for them And it does and as I said it only takes three to five minutes here, so definitely go do that I'll link it in the YouTube description and finally just another bankless shout out here today They have a live stream that I believe at the time the refill has gone out has already aired and ended So you should go check out this video It is a I guess panel debate between Jordi Bay Lena Alex good Gluchowski and Yi Zhang from polygon zk-sync or matter labs and scroll respectively all about Zk evm's and it's being co-hosted. Sorry. It's been hosted by David Hoffman with a co-host Ben Jones from optimism Is it a stacked panel?

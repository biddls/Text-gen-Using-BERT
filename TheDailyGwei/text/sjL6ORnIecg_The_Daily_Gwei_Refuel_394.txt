 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily grey review where I cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host the anthony sauna and today's the 27th of june 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So I still may sound a little bit funny on today's video. I'm still sick Unfortunately don't have covert i've tested myself a bunch of times and just negative every time but I seem to have a regular cold So it's annoying because my I can hear my voice is Is not great and I keep kind of like having to clear my throat and stuff But you know, I guess it is winter down here in melbourne. So it kind of kind of makes sense there But anyway, let's get through what we have to get through today the first thing I wanted to start with was basically a tweet that I put out over the weekend and that kind of shocked some people I think so I said it's sad that I can't be critical of other ecosystems without people just calling me an eath maxi or some other such nonsense For what it's worth eath is less than 15 percent of my net worth and i've never sold any eath So I don't just like ethereum because of bags starting an anon account is looking better every day to be honest and there's a couple other tweets that i'll kind of like, um, I'll read out as well where at the second tweet was basically me saying, you know That 15 number may shock some of you but it's still a lot in dollars terms The thing is that some of my other investments paid off a lot more than eath during the bull And I took profits on those around the top I'm, never selling my eath just throwing it all into staking as I stack it Uh, and then uh the third one, I guess like i'll um, i'll go over once I finish going over the first two So I want to explain to you guys what I kind of like meant by this tweet what I was trying to do with this tweet One I was trying to as I said like tell people that or try to signal to people that like i'm not just in ethereum I'm, not just kind of like all in on ethereum because my whole net worth is tied up in ethereum But it's never all been tied up in ethereum. I've never been like 100 eath I think the highest i've been is probably like 90 percent or something like that um, and and The thing is is that I don't think that just because you've got like I don't know 15 of your net worth in in eath as opposed to like say 90 or 80 percent or something I don't think there's any kind of like number on that that actually like materially means anything If you're actually in it for the technology like for me you guys know i'm in this for the tech like uh first and foremost even when I kind of like Well, I didn't really have much money. I was still in it for the tech for the bros, but yes, okay I was making investments. I was trying to make some money here But the tech has always been what's uh fascinated me most right? So there's that aspect to it, but there's also the aspect of people miss the fact that this 15 percent Uh, I mean that net worth number is inclusive of everything not just my crypto holdings, right? It's inclusive of everything that I have like that. I own every kind of like asset that I own in uh, and outside of crypto so In terms of like outside of crypto it includes my house my car other stuff that I have rather things that I consider to be assets that if I wanted to I would I would be able to resell them for you know, uh the same more or just a little bit less, right? I'm not talking about like other assets that I have like, you know electronics and things like that which obviously rapidly lose their value Uh, but yeah, i'm including like everything like i'm including my retirement account as well, which has like I have a bunch of um Money in there from previous jobs that i've worked the way it works in australia is that your Employer contributes to your kind of like retirement account and I can't touch that until retirement age anyway But I included that too, right? So that's inclusive of everything and then In the third tweet that I put out I kind of clarified this and I said that's you know as I said it's inclusive of everything but if I just Include like if I just kind of like talk about my liquid crypto holdings. It's about 70 right now eighth So it's still quite high right? But let me give you kind of like a A rundown of how uh, 15 percent it arrived 15 percent here how the kind of like number got this low I guess so to speak. Um as opposed to what some people thought it was You guys know as i've said like when I read out these tweets When I read out these tweets i'm never signing my eith So i've said before that I bought most of my eith between 100 and 200 dollars It is like 1100 bucks right now 1200 bucks right now guys Like if like my hundred dollar buys are up what 11 12 x right my 200 buys are up half of that at this point And if i've never sold my eith But i've sold other things and then put the money from those other things either into kind of like savings or into A house or just something else that doesn't lose You know a lot of its value 80 of its value in like a in less than a year like it will eith has like eith Has lost 80 of its value in what seven eight eight months or something like that? Right, of course the the way the kind of like portfolio is going to be constructed Is that eith is going to end up being a lot? Kind of like less of my portfolio simply because of the fact that I didn't sell any I didn't cash any out I didn't kind of like hold that value when it was much higher. Obviously when it was at like almost 5k I was up 50x on my hundred dollar buys right but then once you do the math now It's very very different and that's how it got to this 15% because I cashed out other things That I had made money on put them into more kind of like stable assets And uh and then kind of like if you calculate that and put it all together I guess to this number here Now on that topic the reason why I cashed out things and I bought other things with it and kind of like have I guess like things that I own outside of crypto Is because that's just good risk management and I go on about risk management a lot on the refuel like a lot with you guys You guys know i'm all about risk management I'm, not going to keep 100% of my net worth in eath like it's just not it's not a good risk management strategy It's just silly especially uh for me who's been in this game for a while It doesn't make sense for me to keep that in all my net worth in eath Especially when it can still lose 80% of its value in like seven months right as bullish as I am on eath I i'm not bullish enough to kind of like sacrifice or take like these massive risks for my own personal well-being Uh in order to kind of like um I don't know get some outsize return later on or something like that like i'm still buying eath as much as I can But I do it in as a kind of like a part of a balanced portfolio And I I never believed in like diversifying too much. I don't think kind of like you should be diversified across 100 different kind of like public investments and and things like that I do have a lot of private investments that i've done but look The money money amount of money I put into that is nothing compared to what I put into to cut to kind of like eath here Um, but you know in terms of just constructing a portfolio it doesn't it shouldn't just be one asset class either Right, as I said, I have like my retirement account, which is basically all stocks. I don't touch that that just sits there I don't even put my own money into that. That's just there from old jobs that I had but that's there I have my house. I have my car have some a bunch of other possessions and things like that that I consider to be valuable in investment investment grade possessions um, and that's just kind of like risk management at the end of the day guys like and and as as People call me an eath maxine people say oh, he's just all in on eath. That's all he cares about That's why you know, his net worth is all tied up in eath. That's why he's an eath maxine It's like that's not the case at all like at all The reason I mean ethereum is the tech the reason I love ethereum is because I believe it is the best shot We have at creating a truly decentralized world Uh, and you know you guys know that you guys know that that's what i'm what i'm all about So I think I just wanted to clarify that for all of you because I know you know what I know that People who know me well, which I would consider you guys that listen to me every day and watch on And watch on youtube every day would know me quite well at this point But I think that people on twitter were just kind of like shocked by like oh my god He's this guy promoting eath all the time and it's only 15 of his net worth It's like yeah guys because you know of the all the reasons I just outlined and also as I said, it's good risk management not to be kind of like Over positioned on something and you know Then I in my last tweet here I I said that I had two two many people contact me about this and DM me about this Uh, and then I explained how it was uh, 80 70 percent of my liquid crypto network Now the key word here is liquid crypto net worth because as I said, I have made a bunch of um of angel investments Over kind of I guess like the last couple of years and then most of them are not liquid most of them aren't trading I have no idea if they're ever going to to trade or not as a token or on the stock market nothing, right? Uh at least for most of them. I don't really know Um, so I don't include those in in kind of like my my crypto network I don't include what's liquid what I can what I can basically see in my in my zapper so to speak and when I looked at It looked at everything I had I was like, okay Well, like I'm 80 uh, i'm 70 percent eighth and the reason why I don't talk about what other assets kind of like I own in the percentage on those assets is because I don't want to give A signal to people that they should own this thing or they should buy this thing like you guys know, I hate um kind of like uh People who do that because I just think that it's not really responsible to do that I think people can find things on their own they can read between the lines They can kind of like discover their own investments and things like that And the reason why i'm comfortable always being bullish on eath and talking about eath Is because of the fact that i'm never selling it like that's like number one reason for me He's like i'm not going to be I'm not promoting eath just so I can get like everyone to buy into it and I can dump on them like no That's not what i'm doing at all, right? Uh and same with kind of like any of the other projects i'm invested in i'm not doing that I'm, just like talking about projects that I like giving updates to you guys that you may be interested in And then going from from there. So that's a bit of clarity around that Sorry, if I was just stumbling a little bit there as I said, i'm still sick. So my brain's a little bit mushed right now Uh, but yeah, I just wanted to clarify that for all of you and look I'm not hidden in the business of giving investment advice like i'm not an investment advisor or anything like that But every single person that you talk to that has had experience with investing especially like maybe five ten years experience Especially investment advisors at some point when they're talking to you They're going to mention risk management and it's going to be part of pretty much like the entire portfolio construction If you are getting investment advice from a professional like that is just a cookie cutter thing It's like bread and butter of investing is is managing your risk and making sure that you don't blow yourself up As i've mentioned plenty of times and that's all part of managing it Uh, and i've talked about leverage and things like that before as well and that's what I try my best to do. I've had People in my life have very very bad experiences taking risks very very bad experiences with things like debt And that's why I stay clear of leverage. I learned from those experiences and I just i'm Adimate not to repeat the same mistakes that people around me have repeated and also my own mistakes from the earlier days as well And I try to impart as much as that as I can onto onto all of you But as I said before you have to learn some of this stuff for yourself You have to go through it yourself You have to basically be positioned how you're comfortable to be positioned like i'm comfortable with eith only being 15 of my overall net worth But at the same time I would like to increase that because I am really really bullish on eith So you guys know like all the i'm buying lots of eith down here Profits that I get from other things I roll into eith as well But I figured that like I needed to secure my myself in my own kind of like In my own life with like a house and and you know things for that house, right? Like you do furniture and things like that, right? Um You know not throw everything just like into eith eventually you got to kind of like take profits, uh, and I like spend them on things I just think that there's this weird kind of like thing that maybe comes from the old bitcoin days or I guess like You know way back in maybe 2012 2013 about around hodl. It's like always hodl hodl Don't sell ever like just because i'm not selling my eith guys doesn't mean i'm trying to tell you not to sell your eith Like it's up to you what you want to do You don't have to sell all of it if you want to take profits you can sell half of it and keep half of it It's up up to you what you want to do But like the whole thing is is literally just a meme like you shouldn't always hold everything forever like You know you haven't have an investment that you make choose your time horizon choose when you want to kind of like take profits on it and then stick to the plan like don't just kind of chop and change things and say things like ah You know i'm just going to go all in on this like screw it like i'm Like i'm going to make all my money from this i'm going to sell here. It's going to be awesome Because you're not investing at that point. I would consider that gambling and I think the number one Mistake people make is price targets. They always say oh i'm going to buy this asset and then i'm going to sell it Once it reaches this price, that's that's in my experience the worst way to do it because like nine times out of ten It's not going to reach that price and you're not going to sell and then it's just going to dump and you're not going to You're not going to make much money or you might lose money as well so the way I did it personally was that I didn't have a Price target for each of my investments. I had a target for okay well You know is this kind of like money enough from my initial initial investment? I'm happy with the profits here Yes, okay Take it but I also took in a bunch of other signals one of the biggest signals for me was like Do I feel like this is overheated do I feel like this trade or this investment has run its course for now? Am I still bullish on the project? Uh, you know, sometimes I was sometimes I wasn't and I just took profits from there There's nothing wrong with doing that uh But when it comes to ethic I just can't bring myself to do it Like some people said oh you could have sold at 4k and then bought like so much back now It's like but but like that's a trader like I I don't trust myself enough to do that Like honestly if I sold at 4k I probably would have bought back at 2k like and the thing is after After paying if accounting for tax and everything like that Um, you know, it probably wouldn't have been worth it for the amount of risk that I had taken on then so I think when people say that I'm just saying it's just much easier for me to Stack my eath as I can whenever I can throw it into staking and stick to my strategy that i've had for a while But anyway, i'm gonna leave it at that. I spoke about that a bit longer than I intended to there But I just wanted to provide color for all of you because I know a bunch of you Will talk about this in a discord channel over the weekend and a bit today as well It's something that I think a lot of people can get a lot of value out of just talking through this stuff learning from other People but I always stick to my kind of like rule that you need to learn for yourself You need to just go and do it yourself and and kind of like learn from your own experiences your own mistakes because I can Tell you like what my experiences are I can tell you Kind of like what I learned from a million times But at the end of the day you can just freely ignore that you don't have to listen to me and and the thing is Like you may think i'm wrong too. Like maybe I am wrong I don't know like i'm just giving you my kind of like a view on all of this. So Anyway going to leave it at that for now got a bunch of other updates to get through. So The sepolia public testnet the second public testnet that will be running through the merge transition will be happening on july 6th now I mentioned this before but i'm going to be hosting a live stream with uh, eat staker for this It's going to be similar to the robston live stream. We're gonna have a bunch of people on the zoom call. It's going to be Going on youtube and we're just going to all watch it happen live and celebrate and just you know, have a fun time I don't know if that's if song of day man's going to be on there if he's going to be singing us in or ringing us In he probably will be if I if we kind of like have another one there so that there'll be some of that And there'll be a bunch of entertainment maybe vitalik will join and have like a really bad mic again And give us all kind of like, um, uh, uh, get hurt all our ears and things like that But I don't know i'll get i'll have more details on that soon Around kind of like, uh where it'll be hosted on youtube all that sort of stuff. I think it's going to be hosted on either my channel Or a staircase channel just depends On what happens there, but yeah july 6th is that uh kind of like um a transition and don't forget june 29th A couple days from now the execution layer ethereum execution layer is going to be going through Uh a hard fork to the difficulty bomb by two to three Uh, two to three months here So you have if you haven't upgraded your eighth one execution layer nodes be sure to do so I spun up a bunch of New nethermind nodes over the weekend very simple to do they're humming along really nicely there very happy with that So and never mind is the minority client So definitely if you're running geth right now It might be worth running a minority client or switching over instead of just kind of like Upgrading geth because obviously we want better client diversity there But regardless of what you do make sure you upgrade because if you don't you'll be kicked off and you'll be on a stale network All right So there was another all core devs call on friday and that's where the sepolia kind of like announcement came out on But tim biker had a really quick tldr on uh the shadow fork number seven So mainnet shadow fork seven that I spoke about it went mostly okay There was really just some non-merge related issues in clients that showed up Such as shadow fork related peering issues for eragon and a database related issue for basu both minority clients again Shadow fork eight will happen in two weeks from june 25th with configs to avoid hitting me So this that means that I believe we're going to be doing a lot of work on this But I believe this next mainnet shadow fork will happen after sepolia So we'll have sepolia then mainnet shadow fork eight, uh, and then maybe another one before girly And then hopefully mainnet from there. So yeah, people were asking kind of like about this, uh, and basically Uh how the shadow fork seven went I mean it was basically uneventful except for these sorts of things and uneventful is good at this Stage we don't want glaring issues, especially merge related issues to be showing up at this point in time Uh, and it doesn't seem like they are it seems like the clients are pretty much there There are small issues with minority clients that will get ironed out Like I don't think that they're kind of like showstoppers or anything like that And I think we're at the point now where i'm pretty confident in saying that september is looking really really good For for a merge pending these kind of like two final public test nets But you know, i'm pretty happy i'm pretty confident in september at this stage But as I said like pending the the kind of results of the public test nets pending how the core developers kind of feel I know there's still a bit of some hesitancy about because of these kind of like not these issues and these minority clients But I mean I get that and I get we want these minority clients to kind of like be up to scratch because we want people To kind of choose them over geth for client diversity and things like that But I think that uh, even if they're not totally up to scratch It might just be worth running through the merge transition and then uh post merge worrying about getting the you know These non-merge related issues ironed out because I think that Just generally we need to get the merge out of the way so we can work on the other things Like I you know what guys like i'm not even wanting to get the merge out of the way just so we can get it Kind of like done. I mean I I'm sorry just for all the reasons why I've outlined before about how it's bullish for for ethe and ethereum and all that sort of stuff I just want to get out of the way so that we can focus on the even cooler upgrades coming like proto Dank sharding and a bunch of other things as well And and beacon chain withdrawals too. So just got to get it done as I said I'm pretty confident in september uh as I have been I think mid september is more likely than early september It could happen as like in late sept September 2 but mid sept September is looking likely at this point in time That's my own estimation. Please do not quote me on that and don't say it's an official thing. It's just my own estimation We'll have to see how sepolia goes how the mainnet shadow folks go and how girly goes of course here All right. So speaking of upgrades coming after the merge Vitalik has kind of I guess put together a Blog post called the road to account abstraction. So this is account abstraction has been kind of like an upgrade that has been a long time coming uh, it's been I guess like Chopped and changed a bit kind of put on the back burner people wanted it before eip1559 But then it got put in the back burner for that and then it kind of like fell on the wayside and now it's been Turned into an erc instead of an eip now for those of you don't know the difference An eip is basically an ethereum proven proposal which is something that requires a hard fork to go into the network And kind of like become part of the core protocol whereas an erc is a spec Basically or a kind of like oh, sorry, I should say a standard basically So erc stands for ethereum request for comments, uh as far as I am aware. I think that's what it stands for And basically anyone can create an erc and like as long as people adopt that standard it becomes a standard basically So for example erc20 is the token standard on ethereum that everyone uses but you could just as easily create another token standard Which people have uh, like the nft token standards have different numbers The different ercs but you can create another token standard called erc whatever right? And you and as long as people adopted it, it would become a standard there. So that's what this is attempting to do here ERC4337 is attempting to do the same thing as eip2938 Uh with kind of like account abstraction here so you can kind of like read this uh kind of post from vitalikia describing kind of like the road to uh account abstraction through this erc instead of an eip and kind of like how it can how we can kind of like get there Uh with a road map here. So short term medium term long term and uh and alternatives as well So definitely go check this out if you haven't already it's a pretty interesting upgrade that could be coming through ethereum very very soon All right, so tatum's here from uh, the ens team has shared a guess fresh look at the new ens Web app here. So basically you can see that they're redesigning the whole thing here With different new layouts on both mobile and kind of like desktop and things like that as well Low times have been collapsed as well, which is really really cool to see so some major upgrades coming for for ens here on the interface Front and then we have a new one here So some major upgrades coming for for ens here on the interface front and this is v3 of the ens app And it's basically n said alpha as of this post, which is cool Obviously, uh after that will come beta and then uh, and then public kind of released there so I think this is cool because obviously ens plays a lot into the decentralized identity space and having your Kind of own kind of like web 3 identity and things like that and we want to make that as easy as possible for people to play around with and interact with and especially for people who Coming into this ecosystem through things like nfts. I've actually noticed a pretty big overlap between people who own Well, technically an ens name is an nft but just for the sake of argument technically they own like uh nnft such as like a collectible or a gaming item or something like that like You know, you know the profile picture nfts things like that And they'll also have like an ens name because that's part of their identity like you can't just have the profile picture Uh nft you need the ens name to go with that You need the on-chain verifiable proof or identity of who you are. So it's very very popular with those kinds of people And I think those kinds of people are less interested in going or jumping through a lot of the ux hoops that we've put there For people with you know over the years and they just want something really really simple to use and I think that's what ens app v3 is trying to do here Just make it really easy really kind of like web 2 feel I think in terms of design which I think you know The one good thing about web 2 is that they've got the ui and ux like down pat like I mean Because there wasn't really much innovation happening Kind of like on the um on the product side It's mostly innovation that has happened on the ui ux side of things and even then it's kind of like become a bit boring but Web 2 has this really good thing where it's like one to two clicks to do anything on any of the really popular apps out There and that's what we need to get crypto to we can't just have people doing like 10 different clicks to do anything in crypto It's just going to turn most people off and most people just don't want to have to do that I don't want to have to learn All these new things to just do something simple So if you could register an ens name in a couple of clicks I think that would be the best way to do it and and do it, you know In a really easily so you don't have to mess around with kind of like record Name records reverse records all that sorts of stuff Because I think most people don't want to have to do that Especially ones who are just coming to the ecosystem to have a good time to be entertained through nfts Maybe they don't even care about defi We need to make things easier for them. And I think that's what ens is doing here So really cool to see this looking forward to seeing this progress All right So bartek has a really great thread that I think all of you should read because this is very relevant to questions that I keep Getting asked and bartek starts this thread by saying by now You must have heard that rollups derive their security from ethereum even rollups that have a centralized sequencer So why would you want to decentralize the sequences? Surely it adds complexity and can slow down the l2 block production and you can read the thread for his kind of description about this but the reason why I say I get a lot of questions about this is because I think when people hear me say that layer 2 is inherit security from ethereum layer 1 They think for some reason that layer 2 can't be hacked right or can't be exploited and that's like couldn't be further from the truth As i've explained before a layer 2 is like a set of smart contracts on ethereum It's the same thing as a smart contract that is maybe a defy on layer 1 So for example, you know a defy smart contract on layer 1 or any smart contract on layer 1 ethereum Is technically secured by ethereum because the blockchain is secured That those smart contracts are on is secured by the miners in the future validators But that doesn't mean that it's secured against an exploit Like if there's bad code in the smart contract or if there's code that allows for the exploit to happen then it's going to happen Same is true for layer 2s if they have bugs in their code if they have bad code if there's an exploit there It's going to get exploited and it doesn't matter if it's secured by ethereum or not That's not kind of like what what what kind of like protecting your your um your funds there, right? But what benefit you get of being secured by ethereum is that you get that ultra security and decentralization? That ethereum's kind of like network gives you right that gives you at layer one It gives you the same thing at layer two without the high cost But it can still be exploited all the same because of the fact that these things are just are still smart contracts Like when you bridge into a layer two you're locking your funds on ethereum layer one You're being issued the kind of like an iou on On layer two say it's an optimism or an arbitrum But then the advantage of layer two because it's it's kind of secured by ethereum layer one Is that you can have escape hatches or you can have things where even if the layer two went completely offline You could use this escape patch to get your funds back and you wouldn't need to rely on any kind of like centralized operator To give your funds back and that is the key benefit Whereas something like another chain like if you were to bridge to the avalanche c chain, for example Well, if that chain goes offline or if an exploit happens there or whatever happens, right? Your funds are lost On ethereum layer one because you technically don't own them there because the the ownership belongs to the avalanche c chain Which has either been kind of like exploited or something's happened there So you didn't have ethereum security you had the avalanche c chain security for example So i've gone through this before but I felt like it was worth clarifying because I think people get the wrong idea And you should read this thread from bar tech it goes into even kind of like more depth especially around sequences So definitely give that a read i'll link it in the youtube description All right, so if you want to learn more about the protocol guild, uh, you can go to catch this video You can go watch this video That trent van epps the one of the people running the protocol guilds here presented At protocol labs where he it was called funding the common Sorry at the protocol labs funding the commons event and trent talks about ethereum and its public goods existing funding mechanisms and their limitations Public protocol guilds design response to those limitations and the one-year pilot i've talked about protocol guild a bunch of times Before so i'm not going to rehash it here. You can definitely give this video a watch I think it's about half an hour trent goes through things very very cleanly. I enjoyed it I think he described it quite well. I kind of described his vision for it quite well as well So you should definitely check this out. I'll link it in the youtube description All right, so queen base announced that they are supporting uh polygon Kind of like main net here and I kind of like went over this last week when they announced that but cool to see polygon Kind of like sharing this here where they said you can send them receive to polygon pos chain directly on queen base As you know the seamless user experience for using dapps on polygon and polygon pos becomes the first network to go live on queen base Com and I think they meant like first kind of like ethereum scalability network here and as I said last week You know optimism arbitra much. I love a layer twos are coming I expect that to happen soon, but I wanted to kind of focus on what? Polygon said here around seamless user experience for using dapps Like this is a ux barrier the bridging part of things like when when a user wants to get onto optimism or arbitram Or any other layer two for example, I always bring up optimus and arbitram because I think they're the most kind of like progressed layer two ecosystems right now But when people want to get onto these places even the polygon pos chain They usually have to go through ethereum right ethereum layer one and it's usually costly. It's usually cumbersome It's usually slow and chine clunky because ethereum layer one just just is that way right? It's not supposed to be the user layer and because of that, uh, it kind of turns people off. It's a bad user experience It's not great, but if users can go directly from a centralized exchange to these networks and bypass ethereum layer one all together Then that is like the best user experience in terms of kind of like bridging I think now there are obviously other bridges people can use like hop and connects and things like that But you know in terms of like the most normie friendly stuff It's definitely bridging from a centralized exchange Into these kind of like networks and people can do what they want from there and we obviously want not just a withdrawal But a deposit bridge as well so people can kind of do that whole loop there So again, very cool to see this and i'm hoping coinbase supports the other networks sooner rather than later All right, finally here we have uh bash I think that's how you say their name from rainbow saying first rainbow swap on l2 for me Optimistic l2 transaction hash details. So this is just a link to a transaction that happened on the rainbow app on l2 Where the kind of kind of like a bunch of kind of swaps done here But very cool to see that optimism should be supported on Uh kind of like rainbow soon enough and for those of you who don't know rainbow is a mobile wallet app One of the kind of like best mobile wallet apps out there very very seamless ux as I was just saying These ux barriers need to come down for the everyday user to want to actually use these sorts of things And this is just another one of them just seamless swapping In in a kind of like an app on layer two or in a mobile app on layer two is is you know? Pretty much like that one to two click that I was talking about where users can basically I guess with rainbow say like the user flow is Deposit funds whether that's from a centralized exchange, you know or basically deposit kind of like fiat or user fiat payment processor to buy crypto and then immediately be able to swap that for whatever token they Want on optimism, uh using kind of like rainbow swap feature so that most is only a few clicks there Really seamless user experience and that's exactly what we want to get to so just wanted to kind of like highlight that There today, but I think that's going to be it for now so thank everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel If you haven't yet give it a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the discord channel, and i'll catch you all tomorrow Thanks everyone

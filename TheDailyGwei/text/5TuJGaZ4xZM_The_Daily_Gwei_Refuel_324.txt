 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily gray refuel worry cap the latest news in the etherium ecosystem I'm your host the emphasis on own threads of 28th of February 2022. All right, everyone. Let's get into it. So Over the last I guess a few days. I think maybe a couple of weeks now This is kind of been going on. There was a very very hyped up NFT project called pixel Mon now I think they've been hyping themselves up for many months now and they had their NFT mint where they raised I think 70 million plus dollars worth of eighth so it was a as far as I know a ten thousand kind of like mint 10,000 item mints at 3e per item so obviously raised a lot of money there And what ended up happening was that the art got revealed for all the NFT kind of like art got revealed for this project And it was nothing like it was advertised. I'm sure you guys saw the memes. It was very very low quality Pixel art that looked nothing like all the marketing that pixel Mon had put together now I put out a tweet over the weekend and I basically said pixel Mon 70 million dollar NFT mint reminds me of the insane excess We saw in 2017 and 2018 from certain Ico's it basically always ended badly for the bag holders now the floor price for these NFTs is about 0.36 eighth so an 88% loss from mint price if you've got a floor Floor NFT obviously the rears are probably going for a bit more But still I don't think they would be going for 3e most of them so a loss for basically everyone involved Except the people that did the race obviously they're the ones who ended up with the money They're the ones who ended up with the eighth, and they would be flying right about now, right? So I don't know if this is this projects a scam or anything like that or an outright scam or anything But yeah The the thing is is that pretty much like everyone who bought into these things or most people who bought into these things from From the mint would be would be completely underwater which is which is the sad state of affairs But the thing is we've seen this play out plenty of times before especially during Ico mania during 2017 and 2018 Where there were a lot of Ico's that I mean? Towards I guess like the end of Ico mania They started going really bad where they'd started selling below Ico price and most of them did this and there was so many scams There was mega raises that have tokens that over the years have just completely failed to accrue any sort of value Have dumped really hard against usd and even harder against 8th of course So it's just kind of like this is all just reminding me of back then now I think the most egregious example of the Ico mania going really bad and pear-shaped for people was the Eos sale hosted by or run by Block one company that was making Eos now those of you who weren't around back in 2017 2018 Eos was the first quote unquote eith killer that people really talked about and that's because they claimed They were going to be super scalable They were going to do everything that eith couldn't do they weren't going to have high fees because even back then during the Ico's Eith fees would spike because of the fact that the trend would get clogged right? And you know they had all this fanfare around it and they what they did is they did a year-long Ico and while the Ico was running you could trade the Eos token so you would throw in eith into this kind of like I did this contract it would spit out the Eos at a certain time interval And then the exchange price in the Ico price will get up against each other and there'd be a little bit of profit to eke Out now what this would do it would encourage people to actually to get that profit put eith into the Ico contract And keep doing that but basically a lot of wash trading going on And what ended up happening was that block one raised over four billion dollars worth of eith for the Eos project now Obviously as time went on the Eos project has completely failed and the Eos token is down very very badly against usd at 90.7% last time I checked and against eith it is down even more now what happened to that eith that block one raised well That eith went to go and buy bitcoin so a block one all throughout 2018 And I think some of 2019 were selling their eith and they had millions of it And you know not just them a lot of icos were selling their eith And this is a big reason why eith fell so hard in price fell 94% in one year less than a year in 2018 But I mean to be fair eith going up so much was also due to ico well a large part due to ico demand I think so kind of like give and take there, but still what ended up happening was that block one Obviously didn't do anything for Eos. Eos completely failed and they ended up with 163 thousand BTC which is 6.2 billion dollars today, and now that is just sitting in their treasury So really at the end of the day the Eos project took eith From you know honest people who just wanted to kind of like invest in this sort of thing Traded it for Bitcoin and in the end block one made it out with a massive Bitcoin treasury and all the Eos kind of like Holders that didn't sell and still holding to this day are completely wrecked and a lot of the people Guess trading Eos and relying on and trusting in the Eos project were completely wrecked as well So not to pick on Eos as a particular project here There are a lot of examples of this during ico mania, but they were the most egregious I'm pretty sure that were the biggest ico ever there were others out there that raised hundreds of millions of dollars I don't know if there were any other billion dollar icos I don't believe there was and there was some that kind of like delivered and are above ico price even years later The I can think an example of this is polka dot where polka dot I think ended up raising toward 300 million dollars in 2017 or late 2017 and it's still above ico price today Now, I don't know about against 8 but against USD it definitely is because the ico price was about 30 cents If you adjust for the tokens with that they did and current price of polka dot is what between 15 and 20 dollars Depending on the day that you check and it was higher than that during the mania So I guess there are some out there that kind of like survived and some came back I mean are there for example a perfect example? I was one that came back from the depths of hell and ended up kind of like being worth a lot more Than than I co price obviously and on and it's kind of like highs that are reached back then But for the most part for 99% of projects back then in ico mania basically went to zero I mean given that like nothing ever goes truly to zero, but the liquidity just dries up You know there was a lot of just stuff that just completely died Same is going to be true for most of the nft stuff, and that doesn't mean that icos in particular were bad I think there was some icos that did really well obviously if there him was an ico right well the first ico Obviously that's done very well for their investors um and then there a lot of nft projects that have done quite well But the thing is is that because there's so many things coming out all the time because the propensity for scams is so high The losses are going to be high as well And I guess like my overall point here with this sort of stuff is that this ecosystem has a really really? shitty problem with wasting money on shitty things like 70 million dollars to this nft mint to these pixelmon people the people behind it who I saw on chain have already started kind of Like using that eith to buy other nfts and just spending it as they so wish The thing is is that like when have you ever seen this amount of money raised for people like core developers who actually create the? Infrastructure that make this stuff possible you know even if they these projects should be giving back to public goods like could you imagine? Pixelmon being like okay. Well we're going to donate 1% of you know of the 70 million dollars to core developers, right? That's that's a lot of money. That's seven hundred Thousand dollars to core developers they could donate more if they wanted to but I'm just using it as an example Now imagine if every raise did this just 1% to public goods funding not necessarily core developers Just public was in general it'd be tens of millions of dollars if not hundreds of millions of dollars And one day maybe billions of dollars donated to public goods And we wouldn't have you know such an egregious thing going on here with these with these kind of raises But I guess the incentive is just not there people are super greedy people just don't care about About doing this and it's kind of sad really at the end of the day like the amount of money That gets wasted here and the amount of money get that gets sucked out of the ecosystem Because as I've explained before the reason why prices come down so hard after going kind of like up I mean this there's two major reasons one or if you want to take profits And you know there's never enough liquidity to to kind of like service all that those paper profits or those pepper gains And I think the second biggest reason is that it just people run out of money right like we suck out all the noobs money The the the the more experienced players take from the noobs the scammers take from the noobs and then we're back to square one But we're like okay. Well everyone's gone now I guess we'll wait around for the next cycle for people to show up again, and that's just an unfortunate reality of this ecosystem It's been like this for as long as I can remember I did before I see eyes breathing It was like this. I guess generally a lot of different markets are Similar where kind of like the more experienced players will take from the noobs I get that but in crypto It's just very transparent And it's I gets much more pronounced because it's so easy for people to spin up things like NFT means and I see ours and build Hype around them really at the end of the day all you have to do For a foot to build hype about to raise a lot of money is build hype around something you just do some marketing You know even if it's paid marketing You know maybe get some bots to follow the Twitter accounts that you set up because I think Not pixel mondels another NFT mean invisible friends or something that had 400,000 followers I'm like in there that they don't have 400,000 real followers. No way. I know it was hyped up There were a lot of real people behind it and excited about it But a lot of that was bots now sure enough from what I saw the mint from mint It like kind of like dumped. It was too high. It's like what happened with mechaverse a few months ago It's just it's so insane like the upside is insane for the people creating these things and the downside is insane with people Participating in them, and it just keeps happening like I you know and the reason it keeps happening is because it's particularly newer people And then it's also people who are thinking that they can outsmart everyone else But I'll get in this and I'll get out before you know everyone else has an opportunity to get out I'll be the one who wins this musical chairs game and maybe they will right But it still just perpetuates the cycle that we see with all these sorts of things But anyway going to leave it at that there for now I just wanted to kind of like talk about that a bit today because it is an issue I think it should get better over time as the the I guess like opportunity for profit from these things gets I Guess less over time, but I mean we're gonna still be putting up with this for a while I think for the foreseeable future at least Alright, so on to some more positive news another fresh post from Polina around the endgame bottleneck being historical storage So Polina shared a tweet saying looking at the very long term as roll-ups and data availability a service Sampling in tandem which massive global scale the final bottleneck becomes historical storage now If you don't know what that is definitely give Polina's blog post to read but the TRDR is that blockchains Traditionally have had to store all of their history forever right like this is why if you're the ethereum blockchain is So big and it's it's it's forever growing same with the Bitcoin blockchain. So I mean pretty much like most blockchains out there They just grow and grow and grow and grow if you want to sink a full node now the I guess some The the the ideas around kind of like pruning history or at least doing data availability sampling or doing kind of like Data availability checks and and things like that and also her stop As I said like wiping historical state and stuff is that if something isn't being used regularly Then it shouldn't exist in the active state It shouldn't have to kind of put the burden on all the full nodes to sync it every time a full node wants to come Online or to hold it in its kind of like I guess our storage now for example There are a lot of dead smart contracts out there They got deployed once they maybe got used once and that's it or maybe people deployed them as kind of like testing and prod and no One ever uses them now. Why do they belong in the active state? They don't right and this is this whole kind of I guess like thing about historical storage and like pruning a lot of the old storage or if you kind of like aren't keeping a contract active because it's just Not being used then it yeah, as I said, it shouldn't be part of the active state So this is definitely, you know, if we don't prune historical storage It definitely becomes a bottleneck because what ends it up ends up happening Is that you need to kind of like limit the size of the the growth of the chain? Because it was there's no there's no expiry happening So for example, if the chain is growing a terabyte a year And there's no expiry happening It means that you if you increase the block size by 10% you add another hundred gig on But if the state is expiring every month, right? I mean if you're kind of like expiring half of the state every month Then it kind of like works out a lot better You can increase the the block size so to speak and you can you can store more because you know that in a month's time Some you know, the storage is gonna be pruned there and you'll you'll be better off for it and the chain size won't get unmanageable So anyway, I suggest reading Polina's blog post here this stuff about data availability sampling and historical storage and stuff like that This is I think one of the most complex things to do like statelessness of it as I've explained before State expiry all that sort of stuff is some of the most complex stuff within crypto I believe it's going to take a lot of kind of like people's work and a lot of research development to get us to the stage where this stuff gets implemented But it's coming it's coming along with all the other things that I've talked about like dank sharding and stuff like that But but yeah to stay on top of it Polina has pretty much been covering it a lot lately Their blog on medium is obviously one of the best places to follow along with this stuff I'll link this in the YouTube description for you to go give it a read Alright so a fresh what's new in eth2 from Ben Edgington over the weekend I believe So I've talked about Ben's newsletter a lot on the refuel obviously highly recommend you subscribe to it But as I've said before it's the best way to keep up with eth2 or the consensus layer as we're calling it these days Literally I mean I I do a pretty good job of keeping you guys up to date with eth2 related stuff and merge related stuff and all that kind of stuff But Ben goes above and beyond like Ben he's always surprising with how much he's able to pack into this And that's because he's much closer to it than I am I believe he works for on the TECU client So and he's across like pretty much everything got to do with eth2 So I mean he is probably the number one person in the ecosystem to be putting together something like this And I'm glad he does because it keeps me up to date But I just wanted to give another shout out here because you guys just need to go and read this and get and kind of like subscribe to this And and keep this you know on your radar because this is the bleeding edge at the end of the day like I think The bleeding edge for eth2 at least and it's going to keep you across everything It's going to keep you apprised and everything so you won't be surprised by any I guess like movements in the eth2 arena And even you know sometimes the eth1 arena as well, so definitely a go check this out. I'll link it in the YouTube description Alright so a tweet here from SuperFizz over the weekend that he tweeted out that the beacon chain has reached 300,000 active validators Now I mentioned this I believe last week that we had almost reached that milestone But we're there huge milestone 3000 active validators the most of any I think proof of stake blockchain in existence Now fresh reminder here a validator does not equal a full node there are obviously two parts to eth2 and proof of stake The validators and the beacon node one beacon node can host many validators and last time I checked there were around 4000 beacon nodes So that's basically I guess 4000 beacon nodes is the full nodes of the consensus layer that we currently have And you know 300,000 validators are kind of like talking to those 4000 nodes so to speak So that's kind of like how it works but still I mean this is a huge achievement because it just as I mentioned last week We achieved like the 10 million eth staked kind of like milestone counting the rewards The staked eth as in kind of like the effective stake is 9.6 million that should be 10 million soon And the beacon chain is just kind of like prodding along really really nicely it's going very very well It's getting ready for the merge itself right and everything's happening in that arena too And it kind of just keeps chugging along without without incidents now without kind of events happening So that's really really awesome and awesome to see the 300,000 validator milestone And speaking of milestones Rockerpool has achieved over 100,000 eth staked today So another awesome milestone for Rockerpool they're growing really really quickly for such a young protocol I mean as I've been saying for a while they've been building since 2017 but they've only been live for I think 3 coming up on 4 months now On main net and obviously a new protocol people are kind of like weary about putting their eth in But a lot of people are putting their eth in regardless 100,000 staked a million hopefully soon right I mean probably another few months before we hit a million here But it's great to see them growing because as I mentioned before Rockerpool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol They're trying to basically make it so that you don't have to stake with a centralized exchange or a centralized service provider If you don't have 32 eth which is obviously very very awesome But yeah congrats to Rockerpool on this milestone And finally with regards to proof of stake we have a new fresh guide from SuperFizz on reddit Called how to stake on Ethereum March 2022 edition So in this post SuperFizz goes through how to stake as a solo staker, as a mini pool operator, as part of Rockerpool As an r.e.th holder with custodial exchange staking and then he's got a bit more information in here about other things So I think you can go through the comments read SuperFizz's post here If you are getting started with staking you should definitely give this a read because he gives you a breakdown of each of the different types And kind of like what he recommends obviously being a decentralization maxi he recommends staking on your own or staking with Rockerpool I'm the same guys like it this that's my kind of tier like solo staking, Rockerpool, centralized or kind of like r.e.th holding r.e.th so you get exposure to it Centralized exchange or centralized service provider staking Yeah that's kind of like my hierarchy there, now obviously solo staking is out of reach for most people totally understand that I mean buying 32 fresh e.th today is not something that a regular person can do But that's why Rockerpool and other kind of like similar tools like that exist So give this blog post from SuperFizz a read if you're an aspiring Ethereum staker or e.th staker because it's a really great one Alright so I came across this blog post from AverageJoesCrypto going over the Arbitrum ecosystem so this is basically a post detailing everything happening on Arbitrum From its growth, kind of like what it's doing, what it is, how it works, a lot of the apps on there, kind of like how to access these apps, what each of them do This is a very comprehensive blog post so I definitely recommend checking this out for yourself But I really like this sort of stuff because at the end of the day we are still lacking like the Google of crypto Where you can go to one website, you can kind of like type in what you're looking for and then get it We don't really have that, there are some sites here and there that list things, obviously Arbitrum has their own portal for the projects on there And they have like a sorting list but as far as I know there is not like a Google for crypto where you can say Okay well show me the protocols that I can use to lend my assets on or show me the highest kind of like yield I can get in crypto right now Or show me this or show me that, as I said there are tools out there that do some of this and I think there is a lot of fragmentation there to be honest So I'm curious to see when we will see kind of like a Google for crypto, maybe we won't, maybe the fragmentation will just exist And what will end up happening is that like third parties or other kind of like interfaces will just sit on top and everyone will just know about those I've spoken about this before where I've said that something like a zapper right that tracks your portfolio that lets you kind of like follow other people in a social way And eventually if they do their own kind of like wallet and things like that, I mean they let you zap in and out of things right now But you know basically acting as like an interface for all of these things for you to get into So instead of you going to the yearn website or the arva website or the uniswap website, you just use zapper to zap in and out of these sorts of stuff Or to basically swap on different decks and you know I've used this tool plenty of times myself, it works really well So maybe we don't need a Google for crypto, maybe the Google for crypto is the interfaces that sit on top of these things But anyway getting a little bit off topic there, I just wanted to yeah give this blog post a shout out Definitely go give it a read for a pretty comprehensive overview of the Arvatrum ecosystem You know as I've mentioned before there is so much happening on these L2's now that one person can't cover all of it So I'm sure there's projects missing from this blog post but still it's a great read, definitely highly recommend going and checking it out Alright so Greg Vardy here put out a tweet from the Nethermind team put out a tweet today saying that Arva is coming to StarkNet Because the governance proposal passed yesterday so next week a bunch of people will start phase 1 dev Which will be followed by the deployment of Arva v3 plus some goodies that aren't possible on L1 on StarkNet Awesome I mean as we know Arva v3 was deployed to the EVM compatible chain testnets a couple of weeks ago I believe Two or three weeks ago at this point so the L2's like Optimism and Arvatrum, the other kind of like EVM chains or EVM sidechains like Polygon PLS chain And other L1 ecosystems as well but now they're going to StarkNet which is not as you guys know an EVM compatible chain It is built on Cairo but the thing is the reason why Greg's helping with this is because he works at Nethermind who is building the warp tool Which allows Solidity code to be transpiled into Cairo code in order to work on StarkNet So this is going to be pretty big I mean if this becomes something that's relatively easy to do like transpiling Arva to StarkNet Then I can see a lot of the EVM native apps being transpiled to StarkNet and being deployed there And then it really at the end of the day guys it really just becomes a customer experience kind of thing between these L2's Where they all compete on fees and they all compete on usability and user experience and that's it really I mean at the end of the day look most people aren't going to care about decentralization from the get go I think they eventually will but from like the surface most people just care about cheap fees and ease of usability Which is totally fine like that's what they should care about Now that's what those L2's are all going to be competing on They're going to be competing on basically the same thing fees are going to go practically to zero as Polina has mentioned before He also expects fees to trend towards zero and then everyone of these kind of like as we call them execution layers At kind of like layer two is just going to compete on user experience So that's going to be really awesome to see how StarkNet goes faring against some of these EVM compatible L2's Because as I've said before we don't want everything just to be EVM compatible We want to experiment with more stuff at layer two because you're not tied down to the EVM at layer two You can do anything at layer two as long as you settle your transactions and your call data and all that good stuff To Ethereum layer one as a settlement layer you're free to do whatever else that you want Which turns out is a lot so very very excited to see Aave go live on StarkNet Or I guess Aave v3 go live on StarkNet because that'll be a big win for that ecosystem Alright so speaking about Polygon here So if you've been using the Polygon POS chain over I guess the last few months six months maybe You'll have noticed that there have been errors with the public RPC's where you weren't able to get your transactions in And increased reorgs on the chain as well So the Polygon developers account has tweeted out an update here with investigating these issues with the reorgs and the RPC issues So if you're interested in why this is happening and what the Polygon team is doing to mitigate this You can definitely check out this post The reason I bring it up is because I see a lot of you complaining about this in the discord channel Obviously a lot of you use the POS chain, I mean I use it as well and I've experienced these troubles before too But you know this is kind of like I guess what happens with more quote unquote scalable networks that rely on their own consensus mechanisms Is that it becomes very hard for them to stay in sync And that can lead to these long reorgs where reorgs can happen like a hundred blocks into the future And for those of you who don't know what a reorg is, it basically means that, and this is totally normal for blockchains But it basically means that it reorganizes the chain and the transactions that aren't included in the canonical chain don't ever happen So it actually can affect users, like for example you can do a trade and then that trade could be reorged ten blocks later like it never happened That's obviously a really shitty experience for users and obviously exchanges have to be careful about this because if they accept deposits And then people cash out and then it gets reorged, well that's not good for anyone right But as I said this sort of stuff tends to happen on things due to consensus issues, due to things not being able to stay in sync And because of that there needs to be mitigations put in place Now long term I don't believe any amount of mitigations can be put in place to stop this from happening on any of chains that deal with consensus That's why we keep the Ethereum L1 kind of limited because we don't want to have these issues And everything will just be moving to L2 anyway and that's why L2 is the kind of like long term goal here I think that's a perfect example of everything that I've been talking about lately with regards to the modular stack Because it just makes so much sense to me, like I've never come across something in crypto that makes as much sense to me as the modular scaling stack does And I think a lot of people feel the same way and really we're just kind of like arguing over the implementation details at this point We really do know that splitting up the concerns can retain composability and interoperability while giving you the massive scale that you need Without having to run into issues like RPC issues and real issues To be fair you'll probably still see RPC issues on the L2s if they get really hit Because at the end of the day an RPC is just a node that relays your transactions So if they start getting hit and dosed you can see these things kind of fall over For example, Arbitrum Sequencer fell over because it got dosed and things like that But real should definitely not really happen I'm not totally sure how this works at L2, but there could be instances where things get quote unquote reorg'd Or get dropped and stuff like that, but it's very different to how a L1 would handle it At the end of the day, if Ethereum L1 had a 100 block reorg, forget about it That's a long ass reorg guys, Ethereum blocks for 13 seconds, so that's a 13 minute I'm not even doing the math right now, I just did 100 times 13 there But that's a long reorg, a few minutes or whatever it is And that is really really bad obviously because there's a lot of economic activity that happens on Ethereum L1 So we obviously don't want that to happen and the way to keep that from happening is by making it really easy for the full nodes to stay in sync And making it really easy for the miners that are talking to those full nodes to not go off and essentially reorg the chain And as I said, reorgs are totally normal, but reorg of like a block, right? A block or two within Ethereum's case Any more than that is pretty bad, and it works differently for different chains Obviously the POS chain has faster blocks, the Polygon POS chain has faster blocks than Ethereum But still, I mean 100 plus block reorgs in Polygon is not good for users either So yeah, definitely go check this out, I'll link it in the YouTube description But I think on that note that's going to be it for today So thank everyone for listening and watching Be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet, give the video a thumbs up, subscribe to the newsletter, join the Discord channel And I'll catch you all tomorrow Thanks everyone

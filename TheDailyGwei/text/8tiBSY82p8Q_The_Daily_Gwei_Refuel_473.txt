 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily way refuel where you kept the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host the and the nisa signer says the 24th of october 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So apologies for missing last friday's episode I fortunately had a headache and wasn't really feeling up to doing a refuel. So I figured i'd give it a miss Just for future reference whenever that happens. I'll send a um Message out in the discord channel in the announcements channel there and i'll tag everyone So if you are not in the discord channel yet Be sure to join there even if you don't want to participate you just mute everything. Um, it's just there So you you basically know when there's not going to be an episode It's a rare thing, but it does happen from time to time But anyway, that means that this episode there's a lot to go through. It's basically friday saturday, uh, sunday Um and a little bit of oh, I mean a little bit of monday, right? It's uh, it's monday night for me So let's uh start off with a tweet from brian armstrong So this follows all the drama that happened last week and a bit over the weekend as well around spf Uh from from ftx sam bankman fried and how he's been pushing this new Uh this new bill, uh this new kind of regulatory bill in the us Uh, and yeah We all know the story behind that now brian came out with his tweet where he said worth stating for the record DeFi should be protected in any legislation that seeks to regulate centralized exchanges and custodians Uh, thanks to these two senators here for trying to get this right. So this is senator uh, debbie stapenow, uh, hopefully I said that right, uh and senator john boosman here, uh, so they Are apparently, uh from what I can tell from this tweet trying to make sure that this legislation Does not adversely impact DeFi does not bring any kind of negative externalities to DeFi Which is which is obviously very very cool. Um, you know, I think coinbase has A colored history a check a very colored history and also I think there's varied opinions around what? Coinbase is and isn't within the crypto ecosystem. I think over the past couple years I've grown to appreciate coinbase a lot more than I had in the past They definitely do I think a lot for crypto particularly in the background that you may not be privy to And I don't think anyone can deny that brian armstrong is actually in crypto for the crypto mission. He's not in crypto Just to make money. He's not a proper maximalist like someone like spf He actually believes in the mission and I think queen bases actions over the past couple years especially have definitely um have definitely kind of uh Approved that now there has been some mishaps along the way. There was that thing with that chain analysis company I think that they bought out or something Um, and there were you know that that that was caught doing dodgy things and stuff like that There were some mishaps along the way, but overall I think coinbase has been doing a lot of amazing stuff for this ecosystem So it's great to have someone like brian on board I mean, obviously he's the co-founder and ceo of coinbase But just generally having him on board is a very good signal for our ecosystem because someone like brian has a lot of connections Outside of crypto right? He has a lot of access outside of crypto and we want someone like him talking to politicians not someone like spf um And I think it's a great point for him saying, you know dfi should be protected From any legislation that seeks to regulate centralized exchanges and custodians because the whole point of dfi is for it to be decentralized Self-custodial are very different to the cify model of of custodial and i've gone through this on on the refuel before I think a long time ago. I explained this whole thing But just to rehash this here the main difference when it really comes down to it between dfi and cify is custody And the reason why cify platforms and and you know in tradfi banks and financial institutions are regulated So heavily is because they custody the assets, right? So when you have a non-custodial system where for example a fully decentralized non-custodial system like uni swap Then what are you regulating right? Like you don't need to regulate anything because the entire system is decentralized There's no central controller Anyone putting money in is doing so on their own volition and they have the control over what happens with that money in that platform They are obviously aware or they at least should be aware that once they put their money into a liquidity pool. That's that that Those assets are going to be used and traded with other people But it's not going to be essentially controlled thing and at any time they can pull their assets out and obviously given The way uni swap works. It's never going to be the same as when they put the assets in right? There'll be an imbalance depending on the price of the assets and things like that As opposed to when they first put it in but yeah, it's done non-custodial There's no central like Hayden Adams from uni swap is not in control of those assets, right? Whereas with CFI as soon as you put any money into any CFI platform They have total 100% control over your assets and we've seen the fallout of this recently right with Celsius For example as a big-name one where people couldn't withdraw their funds because those funds do not belong to you anymore They belong to you in you know Maybe I guess like on some form of IOU or some form of contracts or some some terms you have with the exchange But in reality that you know, that's not really worth much right and we look at something like MT gox There's been this whole process to make people kind of whole from that debacle. It's been going on for a very long time now It's been like what to empty goss claps in 2014 at 2022 and that still hasn't settled it has been eight years so far So even if you do get your money back eventually or get some of it back eventually it takes a long time Right because it has to go through the entire legal process. I mean, it's it's a it's a mess, right? So instead of doing that instead of risking that for a little bit of yield Like I never understood people who would put their money on these centralized platforms put lots of money on there to get what five 10% yield. Okay. Yeah, that's a really great yield. But what risk are you taking? You're taking a hundred percent Kind of custodial risk there 100% risk on your assets So if you put $10,000 in and you're earning five ten percent a year, right? It's a yearly say you're earning ten percent a year cool. You're you're like a thousand dollars and on a ten thousand dollar Deposit that's awesome. But the risk is a hundred percent of your your capital, right? Whereas obviously smart contracts aren't immune to this even if they're decentralized they can have bugs in them, right? They can be hacked and things like that but the risk in my mind is still lower than putting it in a C fire platform in terms of and It's not custodial risk, right? So you just got a way up to a hundred percent risk So you just got a way up the risk I always talk about risk, but I think it always comes back to that but that is at the heart of why regulations Exists for CFI and trad fi is because of that custodial nature So in a non custodial world what regulation and a decentralized world what regulations would you even impose? Well, you can't really impose much any that makes sense, right? Because and that's why people are angry about these bills because a lot of it doesn't make sense as I explained last week there are there are provisions in it originally or I don't know if they're still in it that would require every single trade that routes to uni soft to be reported to some entity Or something like that. That doesn't make any sense, right? So because there's no one tracking that stuff I mean you're tracking it for data analytics purposes, but you're not trading at tracking it for anything else, right? There's no central body that tracks that there's no central body that does a ML and KYC on uni swap because that doesn't exist It doesn't make sense for it to exist, right? Whereas with C file obviously it does like you want to do care wise you want to know who's using your platform? even though I'm I really think that KYC is is very young is very dangerous because it creates like a honeypot of our people's information But there are ways to do KYC that don't do that And we're progressing towards that with things like zero knowledge proofs as I've talked about before with the CISMO project for example Where you could have like a badge that basically proves who you say you are and then you you expose that badge to different services to KYC Bitcoin passports doing this as well as a few services doing this but it doesn't it means you don't give your data over to this Massive kind of database that can be hacked and leaked and your information just gets shared everywhere I think that's important point to to to realize that but yeah Anyway, I'm gonna leave that at that because a bunch of other things I want to get through but great to see Brian on our side here Alright, so there's actually a lot of core development updates to get through today, which is awesome But I'm gonna try and get through them as fast as I can So Tim Biko was in a little bit a little thread here And this thread date that this this week goes back to February of of this year Where Trent said just going to preempt everyone in six months dank sharding needs a different name that describes what it does Come on people we can do this and then band tag replied actually like was a day ago saying people couldn't even invent a sticky name for NFTs in three years at hopeless but then Tim replies and says Blob space as the night as the meme for dank sharding and then he replied Again to another person where he said the blobs will be dank once We only sample them rather than fully download each one which is referencing data availability sampling and then He goes, you know, this is the definition of full dank sharding relative to ERP 4844 Now I want to there's two things here I want to focus on explaining the difference between pro dank sharding full dank sharding again using this kind of mean and the meme itself So blob space is actually pretty funny because it you know block space already exists as a term We use it all the time Everyone says it blob space basically references the space of a block that is dedicated to blobs Which is what proto dank sharding is right this blob type transaction Where it expires after a month and then you you have quite a cheaper call data storage for layer twos, right? You guys know this I've been to this a million times But in the context of here of like the defining difference between full dank sharding and pro dank sharding Well full dank sharding will have blobs, but there will be Sampling them rather than fully downloading each one which means that validators on the network or people that want that data To verify it use what's called data availability sampling which from my understanding I'm hoping I'm getting getting this right because it gets quite technical here and this stuff is still like very much in research phase But what it means is that you can sample a portion of the data right like a portion of that and have guarantees I think I don't think the guarantee is a hundred percent But it's like as close to a hundred percent as you can get that that data exists And why that's why it's called data availability sampling because you're sampling a portion of the data To know if it's available and if you do that that means you can validate it you can attest to it You can do all the good stuff with it now that beings a much more scalable system because now it doesn't require every validator to check everything Check the entire data it only requires a sample of it to be checked right and and that's why we've per dank sharding it expires after a month because Storing that for too long would put more requirements on full nodes Sorry hardware climates on full nodes, and we get less full nodes and would compromise on the decentralization of aetherium Well, that's that's a lot there Hopefully you can ingest that but I think if you were to look into this more the things to goo would be data availability sampling aetherium like just google that term And then obviously go to the eip4844.com website And then search dank sharding as well and come up with results those things will give you better explainers I guess a more detailed explainer is the one I can but the reason why full dank sharding is going to take a while is Because of that data availability sampling thing which is quite yeah, it's not an easy thing to do No one's kind of figured it out so to speak But there are different implement a or different I guess like ideas of what implementations could look like but it's all trade-offs again I mean everything's trade-offs right, but it's all trade-offs again, and that's what we're kind of looking at so yeah You can go google those terms to get more information about that Next core development update or at least the commentary on something here so masari put out a tweet About the o fac censorship and about the mev boost blocks being censored and o fac compliant valid aism all that sorts of stuff Where they said if you invalidate us have increasingly chosen to use o fac compliant relays the number of o fac complying Relatives has increased to 52% presenting incredible threat to a theorem neutrality and censorship resistance, but then Tony here Who's been who I've mentioned on the reef will before he's been working on Analytics around me v quote tweeted this and said it's not the validators many validators using mev boost will propose will propose an uncensored block As long as it out breeds the censored block This is important not to mix up And this is exactly what I've been talking about as well where I said that a relay is not a validator a relay is a block Builder it does not validate anything it sends the block the the bundles and the blocks that it Sorry sends the blocks that it builds to validators But it is not a validator and this was important in the context of Attestation level censorship because a relay cannot attest to blocks because it is not a validator right and to Tony's point here Where he says many validators using me v boost would propose an uncensored block as long as it out bids the censored block at the end Of the day guys the validators themselves the reason why they're using flashbots is because it's more profitable for them to use flashbots instead Of one of the other relays most of them or if not all of them probably don't give a shit about Censoring anything right they don't even care about the o fac sanctions But they're just going with what's most profitable, and that's actually a double-edged sword. They don't care about it in either sense They don't care if they're censoring or not censoring to them It doesn't make a difference all that matters to them is the profit and that is what we're designing the I guess some me Sorry censorship resistant techniques for is those validate validators in general being profit maximalist We can't as I've said before we can't expect most validators to not be profit maximalist I expect most to be that but it's on us to build better resilient systems better censorship resistant systems To live in that world because we don't live in the fully altruistic world We're a hundred percent of stakers will only be will be happy with the um the block rewards and the proposal rewards and the sink committee rewards and The normal fear of a new no that's not going to happen especially when the yield can go up so much from and potential rewards Go up so much from any V related stuff now. How do we fix that well all the things? I've mentioned before PBS car lists bringing you know eliminating as much me V as possible all that sort of stuff goes a long Way to fixing these issues of censorship, but the point needs to be made a lot on this I think that validators themselves most of them Or if not all of them do not give a shit about any of this right and at the same time The only reason why so many blocks are quote unquote sent the oaf at compliant is because of that one relay because of flashbots Without flash, but without the flashbots relay, and if everyone was just using an uncensored relay for example It would be 0% the validators wouldn't be censoring on their own at least I Think over 90% of them wouldn't be censoring on their own because we've already seen that in the us right or even the biggest most Regulated entities such as coinbase are not you you know are not censoring at the validated level like they've got their validators What they could be using me V boost relays or not, but at the validated level they're not censoring They're not censoring for inclusion, and they're not censoring for attestation And I mean inclusions a bit harder to track, but as far as we know they're not doing it I haven't seen any evidence of them doing this So really it just comes down to which parties want to censor or want to over comply in order to protect themselves And which ones don't? But the fix here is not to ask that question at all and not to even think about that the fix is to make it impossible for people to censor and or to make it extremely hard or unprofitable for that to happen and All those solutions that are being worked on are working towards that goal, so yeah That's enough on that one I've spoken about that a lot lately and next up We have some updates of the ultrasound money website So Alex here who works on the ultrasound money website put out a tweet saying What whatever number of iterations you think we make on widgets before we release them? It's more new version of ultrasound money is now live so you reorder of the widgets on website Streaks updated for new deflationary block methodology and added timeframes for gas widgets So it's been pretty exciting to be on ultrasound money website Lately because of those higher gas prices leading to a almost deflationary Eth since merge so we got to I think point plus zero point zero one percent since merge And you can see it's come down a lot right here over the last 30 days I believe we're still net deflationary which is very cool and the supply change. I mean this is insane We've only issued net issued you know including the burn 2100 each since the merge which happened 39 days ago under proof of work that would have been 460 6000 eighth guys like that's just absolutely insane and you know I've said it before and I'll say it again This is going to play out eventually in the price like I'm not going to guarantee that obviously But I strongly believe it will there's no guarantees, but you know it all logically makes sense to me anyway Let's check out some of these updates so one of the updates is this thing here where you can actually have a? Variable time frame here on the ultrasound barrier so the ultrasound barrier as you guys know is that? Barrier that the gas price needs to be at for each to be deflationary per For it's it's for us to be burning more Ethan We're issuing per per slot here per block and you can actually change the time frame up here So I can go to 30 days seven days And then I can go to 30 days and one day and whatever and you can see it on my screen So everything in orange is ultrasound everything in blue is not ultrasound so over the last 30 days It's been pretty good and look how high we went like on the above the ultrasound barrier And we don't go very much below it which is very very cool I mean we're at 11 way right now the barriers 15.4. Way I mean that's not very low and that may I mean and we're still burning eight even if we're under that barrier Which I think is is obviously very important as well, but yeah guys like this website ultrasound money has become just such an amazing resource I mean I remember when we were tracking these sorts of things All these sorts of things like it's not just the burn But it's got everything to do with with eighth as an asset. It's a issuance comparing it to different things I remember this was all completely scattered around then we got the ultrasound money meme Then Justin Drake said like let's build the website and got a team together And they built it and they got the bat signal I mean it really has come such an amazingly long way, and I love this website I visit it like probably every day at this point because I like keeping track of the supply chain since merge I want to see this get to like 0% since merge because I just think that would be a cool milestone But yeah anyway kudos to to the ultrasound money team for putting out these updates very cool to see that Next up here is a great thread which I'm not going to read But you can go read from proto lambda discussing the blob terminology that I was talking about before But he doesn't just discuss that he goes through a whole history of sharding on Ethereum now those of you who don't know the history. This is the thread to read honestly I haven't learned some stuff from this and I know the history so you should go give this thread a rate I'll link it in the YouTube description below, but it's highly recommended definitely if you want to learn the history of sharding And speaking of our MEV Sensitive resistance all that good stuff there marry us from the geth team put together a blog post on Ethereum's biggest issue that no one's talking about with regards to MEV PBS like clients private or private order flow This is a short blog post but I definitely recommend giving it a read to get further context around MEV and sensitive resistance and How this difference was differences between public order for and private order flow and how that affects all of that I'll link this in the YouTube description below for you to give a read Barnaby here from the robust incentives group at the Ethereum Foundation announced that on the 21st So three days ago now the launch of a rig open problems Which is abbreviated as ROPS a collection of problem prompts that they're looking to solve with anyone who wants to tackle them So they being the robust incentive group the problems come with some questions to answer but could lead to more open-ended Explorations and you can check out this resource here for some of the questions and if you want to get involved here This is a pretty good place to I guess be and get involved with if you're interested in Ethereum research problems some of the deepest problems some of the deepest research within aetherium So I definitely recommend checking this out if that sounds like something you wanted you want to do I'll link this in the YouTube description below for you to check out Alright, we have an update here from the rated network website so they've basically overhauled their entire website from what I can see if I go to The the page here. Yeah, so they've overhauled the entire website here on rated network Which I've shown before which basically tracks all the different Staking services and stats around them and it looks much better now I think I love the the look of the the view here you can see here the staking entities such as lido Coinbase Kraken Binance and you can see the network penetration the consensus client distribution So it's looking pretty healthy there, right and then you can also see block space distribution, which is really cool So you can see which which are relays they're talking to and if you know how much vanilla blocks there they're proposing So let's take lido For example, you can see here 47% of lido's blocks are going through flashbots, right? Block space is distributed through flashbots. Whereas 35% is vanilla blocks Which means they're just vanilla validators and then you have a few more relays here as well Like blocks route manifold block native and Eden and then as I said before Coinbase isn't actually using in any MEV boost relay right now as far as we can tell and that's that this kind of like vanilla Blocks at a hundred percent here on the coin base. So that's what I was talking about before where I said We can't be certain that coin base isn't censoring anything on their end with their validators But we can be certain that they're not actually pushing anything through any censoring MEV relays at least right now They could be in the future. Whereas other exchanges such or other, you know exchanges that are running staking services such as Kraken and Binance are so Kraken's 43% flashbots Binance is 52% but Kraken has over half of their blocks going through vanilla blocks and Binance at about 43% But anyway, I used to go check out this resource. It's really great. This is just one thing they're tracking They're also tracking the things like deposit addresses here so you can see which deposit addresses are the the leading ones and their network network penetration and consensus client distribution and Block space distribution and then you and then there'll be more stuff here that's being teased on the left That's grayed out right now to track or to track a bunch of different things around the Ethereum and beacon chain So definitely go check that out and check out the blog post For more detailed explanation of that All right, that's all for core dev updates on to some onto a layer 2 update from Arbitrum So I'll be trim announced that Binance us and now supports the pause and withdrawals from the arbitrum 1 network This is really cool because the US users can't actually use a vanilla Binance They barred them quite a while ago, but they also spun up Binance us because you know They obviously don't want to lose that market share So now if you are an arbitrum 1 user and you want to be able to bridge in and out of it without going through Ethereum layer 1 or through a main net you can now do that with the Binance us exchange They're very cool to see this Congrats to arbitrum on landing this it's going to lead to more growth for arbitrum. I bet All right, so if you've been waiting for a while for the grid plot plus lattice ones to come back in stock Well, they've been fully restocked It's restocked and now you can go get one at grid plus dot I own now for those of you don't know what the lattice One is it is a hardware wallet, but it's not your usual hardware wall It is the best hardware wall in the game and no I am not paid to say that reason why it is the best is because the amount of security that packed into this thing is Absolutely insane. I mean ledger is like a small little device, which is fine, right? I mean I've used ledger in the past. It's totally fine. There's nothing wrong with it But the grid plus lattice one goes to the next level it definitely Gives you much more to play with it's got this concept of a safe card where you can have these cards which act as like a backup and act as a way to to kind of like Not just backup or like use different grid pluses with that card Use different lattice ones with that card. I should say it's also got It's also a much bigger device with a full-fledged screen here full-fledged touchscreen But you can see it shows things like the entire detailed aetherium transaction So there's no need for you to blind sign like you do on a ledger device because you've only got that small screen there And so many other features here that I would be talking about this for ages if I kept going on about it And I've already shield enough here, so I'm not going to continue But yeah, if you are looking for a lattice one you should definitely go check it out there now restocked You can now add them to the cart buy it do all that good stuff I'll leave a link in the YouTube description for you to do so Alright, so Johnny from element finance is Teased over the weekend what they're currently focusing on so they're focusing on something called hyperdrive with a real name of that pending Council protocol which is governance 3.0 for element finance and decentralized front-end a Decentralized front-end and that's a codename pending so there is a brief explanation of what what each of these things are in this thread Which I'll link in the YouTube description below of course, but essentially what hyperdrive is is that? It's a codename for their new a mm research featuring no terms for LPS just set and forget it profitable L paying without perverse incentives Ability to short long fixed rates and the greatest SDK ever the council protocol self-explanatory It's a new governance framework and a decentralized front-end again. It's self-explanatory, but as Johnny says yeah We're in the earliest development stages of a new type of decentralized front-end that can provide a rich user experience without a back-end server The plan is to give this to the community so we can all work to improve it together More details soon so a lot of really cool things being cooked up at element finance I'll link the thread in the YouTube description for you to check out below Now moving on to an update from empiric So they just published a new educational guide explaining smart contract events on Stark net and how to leverage them to trustlessly verify Empirics data feed so for those of you don't know Empiric is trying to bring decentralized and composable data to the Stark net ecosystem in plain terms that means things like Oracles right a building oracles to get outside external data bring it into the stock net ecosystem for deeper projects to take advantage of And and yeah, there are there are newer protocol They're definitely building a lot of really cool stuff And you should definitely check out their educational guide explaining things here more probably on the developer side of things But if you're interested in this sort of stuff you can check it out. I'll link it in the YouTube description below Next up here. We have a thread from Seb from zapify so Seb said zappa will be taking more and more of a social spin with time partially inspired by far cast are Wanted to share my thoughts on how I think web3 social will look like and of course I'll link this thread for you to check out I wanted to make a few comments about this so I got laxes to far cast over the weekend It's basically an ethereum based decentralized alternative to Twitter It works really well like I've only put one like cast. I think they call them cast out On there so far. I just said hello world but there is a pretty vibrant ecosystem on there already it is still invite only so I guess like that's why the Ecosystem is pretty vibrant and and pretty chill because it's not just like a free-for-all But I think that between far caster and lens and a bunch of other things that are being worked on in the decentralized social media space I think we're actually going to get to a point where we get something that can actually compete with Twitter I've said it before and I'll say it again The power of Twitter is the network right that the network the social media network is the network that the network is the network Right that the network the social graph But what happens when we collapse that to the point where the social graph can be taken with you anywhere? So any front end to any service like you don't have to lose your social graph if you change services I think that's incredibly powerful now Obviously is they're going to be in top interoperability between far caster and lens. I don't know maybe they will be maybe they won't be but It's all based on an ethereum wallet for example or an ethereum address then the services themselves Don't have to do anything else they can just pull data From and pull the social graph from the ethereum address and store that all on on chain right and then the user can port that between different social experiences whether that be a Far caster or lens or even a zappa right for example, so I think we're going to get to a point I've been skeptical of decentralized social media in the past, but I'm starting to see it come together I definitely am I'm starting to say more people get excited about it, too Which is always good and as I said those switching costs are the main barrier to entry But once we iron those out and once we make it so that people are I guess incentivized to switch It's a better experience. I think we're going to get there I do think so I had more faith than ever that we're going to get there That I've ever had before that we're going to get there, but it's going to be a while away obviously We still need to scale and things like that and to make something fully fully decentralized There would need to be a dow attached all that sort of stuff, right? It's not going to happen anytime soon, but I'm seeing the pieces come together That's for sure, but yeah definitely give sub threat threat a read here. I'll link it in the YouTube description below oh And finally here we have something from socket today, so they've been out not today a couple days ago They've introduced something called socket scan dot IO Which is the first multi chain explorer then for those of you those of you who don't know what socket is? Especially a platform to power truly multi chain apps, so they have a bridge protocol I'm sorry there They have a protocol which I go get all the bridges From things like a cross bridge to high from bridge to hop bridges all the bridges right they aggregate that and now using the socket Explorer you can you can basically explore all these bridge transactions by searching the transaction hash here So as it says here track all your bridge transactions across the theorem B&B chain Polygon avalanche nurses chain Phantom optimism Arbitrum and Aurora and any future networks that socket decides to to support here so very cool to see this I think this is Obviously going to be very good for users a lot of users tend to kind of go into support of the telegram But you know where's my money. I don't know where it's gone because I can't actually See it once it's in the bridge. They haven't got visibility over it well This is going towards fixing that or at least rectifying that and preventing a lot of those you know where's my money questions? Ending up in the in a discord channel so so yeah, but anyway, I think that's it So got through it all in 30 minutes lost my voice almost there I kind of um just fire as in of information But as usual everything's linked in the YouTube description for you to go check out, but that's going to be it for today So thank everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet get a bit of thumbs up subscribe to newsletter join the disco channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone

 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily wave review where I cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host. The sasana. There's the 22nd of august 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So we have some merge related news today the clients are starting to come out for the merge So if you're running I guess like most of the clients I think are out right now Or at least they're kind of like been rolling out during the day There is a new geth client out which is merge ready. I'll mainnet merge ready I saw lighthouse release one and teku. I believe the others have either been released or are in the process of being released. So Obviously, uh post merge you'll need to run your own execution layer clients such as geth or nethermind And your own consensus layer clients such as prism or lighthouse or any of the other ones out there They all work. So definitely go upgrade your nodes If you are running a solo staking setup, and I you know if you're not if you're kind of like staking with a provider such as a centralized exchange or a or a service provider or Even something like a rocket pool. They'll kind of like handle that on the um On that that side for you if you've uh, just kind of delegated your stake there Uh, but if you are kind of like running your own I guess like staking setup your own solar validator Dap node is some software that you may have come across in your travels It is basically a very nice streamlined graphical user interface or gooey for you to manage all of your node infrastructure And now they announced multi-client support on Dapno Which is now live so you can install the new kind of core of Dapno software install a new prism And you can now find your keys to the web pre-signer and change cl clients with one click so you can change from prism to lighthouse to teku to load star to Anything else any of the clients there with one click, which is awesome I think you know you can see the gif here of how easy it is to change There's basically a configuration menu here and a drop down where you can select between the major clients Which is just absolutely awesome to see there so great to see Dapno releasing this this year Obviously client diversity is critically important to the health of both the execution and consensus layers Consensus layer client diversity is looking very healthy as I went through last week execution layout We're going to work on post merge. I think everyone wants to see the merge go through smoothly with with what we've got currently in terms of The share of the network and I mean basically we're at the point where if geth works fine Then most of the network is going to be fine But definitely post merge we want to work on execution layer client diversity as well So if you're running Dapno installed the new update here and you'll be able to have access to all these new features Alright so Brian Armstrong from Coinbase shared this interesting little chart here today that I wanted to kind of go over with all of you But this is basically the G20 plus crypto regulatory tracker. So it's got a list of countries here and basically six different columns Where basically there are labeled crypto framework tax AML CFT slash CFT travel rule stablecoin regulations and CBDCs and basically the status of each of these depending on The country so let's go through, you know, the countries that get brought up the most the United States United States on the bottom Doesn't have a crypto framework and there's been no regulatory process that has been initiated here There is regulation in place for tax of course for AML and CFT for a travel rule nothing in place Nothing kind of like being worked on for stablecoin regulation, but there is regulation underway for CBDCs Then you look at the other side of the spectrum, which is China where? Crypto framework, they're just basically prohibited all crypto tax. It's because it's prohibited. There's no tax revenue AML not needed because it's prohibited travel rule You know not needed because it's prohibited and stablecoin regulation again, it's prohibited but CBDCs they have regulation in place So obviously China is taking the approach of a fully controlled and regulated CBDC where the CCP has complete I guess overview of absolutely everything happening in the world I guess I mean, I wouldn't even call CBDC crypto, but they want to see everything happening on the digital currency space Whereas you know the United States obviously is on the other end of the spectrum there and you can see the other countries here And where they kind of fall, but I think you know as Brian says yeah This is something that's not been widely reported on but each country around the world or at least kind of like the The g20 plus countries are definitely looking at this and I mean here I am in Australia at home here Apparently we have regulation underway for a crypto framework tax and AML was in place. There's no travel rule There's pending stablecoin regulation and pending CBDC regulation But I did say today that some news came out that Australia wants to kind of like put a framework around tokens I don't know what that's gonna look like I have a feeling it's gonna follow very closely with the existing regulations that exist in the US and maybe even other Parts of the world like the UK Canada. I don't know if New Zealand has anything but generally you know much of the western world Or I guess like what is regarded as the Western world Western democracies follow similar regulations So we'll have to see how that kind of shakes out. But yeah, I think people often may get this kind of like Idea that these countries aren't looking at crypto in any real big way I mean there's obviously a lot of work to be done and it's funny how like the two Most filled out columns here are tax and AML because those are what has basically been front of mind right like tax obviously the government's want to collect as much tax as possible and Obviously they want they need to be able to give the clarity there so people can actually file their tax return file it accurately and AML which is anti money laundering or just I guess like regulations around money laundering in general are top of mind for them too as We've seen over the last few weeks, especially in the US And then there's like travel rules and things like that which are less filled out So yeah, just wanted to put this on your radar. You can go check out this chart. I'll link in the YouTube description below But yeah, I mean at the end of the day whether we want it or not regulations are coming It's just all about getting the I wouldn't say good regulations But maybe like the least worst so we don't end up with like the China end of the spectrum because it is a spectrum at the end of the day I'd rather be you know much more on the spectrum of Maybe how the US is approaching it even though the u.s. Is regulations aren't good either like I as I said It's at least worse system not a good system But we don't want to end up like China where they just basically outright ban everything and only have cbdcs Which are complete surveillance complete control that's where you know we don't obviously want to be heading into so yeah It's great to see that most countries aren't heading in that direction at least not now All right, so back on the tornadoes Cash news so he was a here's a thread posted on Twitter about the little protest that happened in Amsterdam Yeah, so there was an protest in Amsterdam for the arrested tornado cash dev Alex Percival Which I guess like is an unfortunate thing that has to be a protest for this, but as far as I know he's still under arrest I don't know if he's been charged formally with anything yet Which is really weird considering how long he's been under arrest for so I think he's still under arrest But yeah, there was a I guess like a decent showing here of people considering that this is obviously one city in the world And obviously happened very quickly But you can see the thread here of the people that attended and just great to see that people are protesting this I guess publicly now you know depending on your view on protests in general whether they do anything or Or not that's a whole nother kind of like I guess some a whole nother topic of discussion I'm not going to get into but I just want to make sure that I'm not getting into the whole thing I'm not going to get into but I just wanted to put this Thread on your radar to know that there is people out there fighting in any way that they can and kind of protesting in any Way that they can for I guess justice here when it comes to tornado cash and especially when it comes to Alex who is I believe the only tornado cash dev that has been arrested so far But I mean hopefully he will be the last hopefully he'll be freed but you know I'm not holding my breath there I feel like there's possibly more arrests to come, but yeah, just wanted to hide that for you guys There is I guess probably a bunch more to get through with regards to the tornado cash stuff But I did cut it down because I know I've talked about it a lot on the refuel and I explained last week I think it's really important But I don't want the reef every refuel from now on to just become talking about this because I think most of us Up to speed with everything at this point and and understand where everyone kind of like sits But there are some new developments that happen over the weekend that I want to talk about especially new threat So this one comes from Alex van de sand who is the an og og in a theorem. He's been in a theorem since 2014 So he has been around the block so to speak so he put out a tweet thread where he said there's no o fac fork Social consensus lashing or uasf needed we've gone through this on the dow wars already if too many validators refused to add a transaction They can be D dos if they refuse a valid block then they're the ones forking and risk slashing how to D Dos a censoring validator flood the network with very with with very complex Transactions that by the end of them touch tornado cash because of a halting problem the validator can't know what they do What the transactions do without executing them fully so they're forced to do unpaid computational work of course if there are enough Nonsensoring validators the attacker has to pay for some of the trip submitted transaction So it needs a threshold to work But if there are enough on censoring validators where then we've got what we want it just takes a bit longer But isn't there a risk that some institutions would want to create what would basically be a poa network ran only by us compliant entities Yes, those are the bank chains being developed tons of those will exist. I just wouldn't call them ethereum So this is another kind of like technical I guess you could call it solution to this problem of censoring validators here But I am not sure how workable this is as Alex said that there is an economic cost here of submitting these transactions And I'm not sure like how much of an impact it would have I think that this is just one solution of many But I just wanted to put it on your radar that this does exist but at the end of the day like the motivation for doing this probably isn't there because even if like 90% of the validators on the network is censoring your transactions say they're tornado cash transactions There is still 10% that aren't so your transaction is going to get into a block eventually anyway The and this is what I think a lot of people don't realize is there's two kind of like main things at play here There is censorship in there the kind of valid is not including your transactions in blocks But still mining blocks or proposing blocks on and protesting to blocks on the canonical chain post merge So that's one form of it That form is less of a concern or I guess like much less of a concern than the other form Which is validators refusing to build on top of a chain that contains? Censored transactions or contain sanctioned I guess like transactions in blocks that would result in a fork and they would basically be two chains There would be kind of like the o-fact chain and then there would be the canonical chain now Where social slashing would come in or that I guess like the real ethereum chain rather than the canonical chain where social slashing would come In would be the community coming together and saying well these people basically want to mine on their o-fact chain We don't want them in the real ethereum, so we're going to slash them on the real ethereum They're probably gonna end up getting slashed anyway from my not mining on the main chain or stuff inactivity leaks But you know we're gonna take away their stake because they no longer represent the I guess will of the community Whereas I don't think social slashing would be used in the scenario of You know a lot of block producers or a lot of validators not including sensitive transactions because and Polina put an opinion out about this Where they said you know they've refrained from commenting on the topic because of an unpopular opinion Actually, sorry I should give some context here So Polina is quote tweeting Taken's theorem who basically highlights that ethermine which is the largest ethereum miner has stopped including tornado router Transactions over a week ago, so they've stopped including those transactions at all and this is on proof of work This isn't even talking about proof of stake here, but then Polina quote tweets this and said you know that They think this is an unpopular opinion But they said ethermine or any block producer has the right to include Transactions as they please as a community we should open a dialogue help them and attempt to resolve such issue issues using diplomatic and legal Means and then component continues it is perfectly reasonable for a block producer to comply with their Jurisdictions regulations as a community we shouldn't use fear of slashing or social vilification pressuring them to exist etc Rather help them fight these regulations if they are unjust And then they go on with a bunch of other things and you can read this thread I'll link in in the YouTube description, but I want to say that like after thinking about this a lot more I actually agree with Polina here obviously. I don't want to see any censorship on the network, but at the end of the day whether it be miners Validators slash block producers or anyone producing a block has always had the ability to include whatever transactions they want in a block you normally the transactions get included by Fee priority right if the people paying the the larger fees get included first That's that's how how the fee market works on aetherium, but if the block producers don't want to include a transaction Well, that's totally on them Yes It is a form of censorship But it is different to what I described before around building on the non canonical chain and basically forking off into your own chain So from that perspective I agree with Polina here though I would say that even though I agree with them on this it's also a very bad kind of I guess social signal if like 90% of the network is censoring transactions or not willing to include transactions in their blocks Yes, your transaction will be eventually included in a block, so it's not a critical You know be issue where essentially you're completely barred from using the network altogether or interacting with certain contracts altogether but it is a really big kind of like issue in that the aetheriums credible neutrality takes a hit and aetherium censorship resistance takes a hit even though you can still your transactions in From a pure social perspective it is it takes a hit right the credibility takes a hit there So as Polina said we should work with these entities in order to fight bad regulations Enable them to be able to include transactions in blocks without even knowing what's in them So for example having base layer privacy or having things like a shutterized beacon chain where you don't know what the transactions are until they're actually Mined which would be a really nice stopgap solution How between kind of like having full base layer privacy and no privacy at all for transactions? So using those kind of things to help them would be better Then I guess I constantly threatening them with social slashing now. I want to clarify my point here I am very much in favor of social slashing as still a last resort, but as something that to be used if Block producers are building on top of a non canonical chain, and they're just refusing to build on top of that chain I'm not necessarily in favor of using it for block producers that are just censoring transactions We're not including transactions in their blocks But those transactions are eventually included anyway And it gets very murky when you go down that path because as I said there is a strong Social signal that gets sent if a lot of the network is censoring and it kind of like waters down aetheriums credible neutrality But at the end of the day that should be solved on the technical layer Rather than the social layer with those kind of like privacy things that I've been talking about but if There is kind of like an attack on the network where the chain is splitting because of that censorship because the validators are not Attesting to or proposing blocks that contain these transactions at all It's more a testing kind of post merge well there or not you know building on the the the I guess like right head of the chain right the canonical head of the chain then I am definitely in favor of using that nuclear option And I think it should be used if there is no other Other way to kind of like get around this or other way to kind of rectify this issue But I am definitely more in favor of the technical solutions before we start using any social solutions But the credible threat that social slashing exists needs to be put out there We need to kind of signal that we're willing to do this and at end of the day when push comes to shove and we Actually need to use it. We better be ready to use it like this shouldn't be a strong social signal put out there And then we don't actually use it now. Hopefully it never comes to that point, but we're not here to hope for things We're here to plan for worst-case scenarios, and that is what will happen in the worst-case scenario But I'm gonna keep promoting the technical solutions such as PBS and CR lists and shutter eyes beacon chain and privacy at the base layer in general because that way The block producers have I guess like plausible deniability that they don't know what transactions they're mining So how can they possibly adhere to any kind of like sanctions for example? How can they possibly censor anything if they don't know what the transactions are until they've been proposed now that doesn't obviously stop people from A refusing to attest to a chain that contains censored transactions or it's contained contains like sanction transactions But that's different to I guess not including things in blocks because they've been sanctioned and stuff like that right so Hopefully that clears up some of the I guess some nuances around that there's also a really excellent post here from I gotta get this Tab it's gone It's lost on me from our bit max here where they talk about how? There are a lot of technical nuances when it comes to a theorem proof of stake and censorship and this blog process linked at the bottom Here I highly recommend giving this a raid because I actually learned a lot from this and bit makes research is one of the best Research blogs out there, but basically there are seven different scenarios here that could happen in The o-fact situation on a proof of stake a theorem and these are the seven listed here I will actually get technically eight here, but like the seventh is just ignoring the o-fact rules altogether Which I guess is an exclusive to a theory proof of stake so technically there's seven But I'm not going to go through them all I want you to read this blog post Because it's very important to understand the technical nuances with your improve of stake and how it's fundamentally Different to a proof of work network on the technical side especially if you improve of work in saying that The similarities and why I've been saying that proof of work proof of stake doesn't matter is in the fact that censorship can happen on both in very similar ways and those two main ways of Not including transactions in blocks at all and then refusing to build on a chain that has sent that Sensions transactions as part of the chain right so those are still the same whether it's proof of work proof of stake The pause POA doesn't matter right what matters is the technical nuances when you get into the weeds of how the? Protocol actually handles this on a technical level and that's exactly what bit makes this blog post goes through so I highly recommend checking That out. I'll link it in the YouTube description below Just a couple more things to get through here bandtech has been putting together a really nice a little I guess graphic here showing The individual validators, I think I talked about this last week about which ones have committed to not censor And which ones haven't said anything yet, but they've also broken down the individual Lido validators by stake so everyone always says Oh, well Lido has over 30% of the stake yes, they do right yes There is potential centralization vectors there, but Lido is not a monolithic organization It is an organization made up of 29 different Operators here as you can see listed out in this graphic and each of those operators has a different percentage of stake allocated to them, but none of them have a Kind of like a 30% at all like not even close to that So I think right now Lido governance can't actually kick out any validators I think it would up be up like Lido the Lido Dow I'm not 100% across like what the powers are right now Lido is certainly not decentralized at this point in time But I think it's very important whenever someone brings up Lido as this monolithic entity to tell them what no it's not I mean there is the STE token which I guess like introduces It does introduce centralization into the mix because obviously these stadium providers are at the mercy of that st Eth because the st. It has a claim on the eat in in their services But the services themselves are all part of different providers there. You know they're not all based in the US right there They're globally distributed here. They have different teams behind them and and some of them are just pure staking providers some of them are Teams that do multiple things like for example you you have here Prism right prismatic labs they build an e2 client right they're building the prism client But they're also a validator as part of lighter here So there is just kind of like a very diverse set of validators a very diverse set of up Sorry, staking providers, and this list is going to grow over time So yeah, I just I have a pet peeve about people saying that Lido is this monolithic entity But in saying that we obviously don't want Lido's dominance to be as high as it is in general like just for the kind of like reasons I outline with the st is token especially and I've said before how I believe that once withdrawals are enabled we'll see this great reshuffling of steak and also As more competition comes online and improves there's going to be people staking with that instead of instead of Lido there So yeah, I just wanted to highlight that little graphic there for you in the I guess like same Topic of the kind of like sanctions and validator centralization and everything like that And Victor Bunin put out a really great great kind of tweet here I was quote tweeting something that Matt Huang put out from paradigm But basically he said digital minder that without privacy all that We're building is the most perfect version of warrantless financial surveillance technology And he's hit the nail on the head here both Bitcoin and etherium like the vanilla networks themselves have Absolutely no privacy. They are so bad at privacy that if you send funds from one of your dresses to another one and you only do one transaction those Addresses are forever linked for there's no way to unlink them So that's how bad the privacy is and that's just kind of like one simple example So because of that if we don't develop privacy solutions if we don't improve privacy on etherium Then we are creating as Victor says here the perfect version of warrantless financial surveillance technology Which is dystopian as hell like that is the worst outcome of this technology And that's why I've said time and time again Privacy is both a right and privacy is and should be one of the top priorities right next to scaling for the etherium Ecosystem because without privacy none of this shit means anything like if you're him does not give people More freedom and and and give people kind of like more sovereignty if there's no privacy I'm not talking about you know the fact that we have to have base layer privacy I'm talking about everything that can add more privacy to aetherium should be worked on should be kind of put out there I know we've kind of like taken a backseat here because of the o fac sanctions and everyone's kind of like in limbo right now But that shouldn't take away from the fact that we need to keep building privacy solutions And we need to fight for them We need to fight the regulations in the real world to ensure that we can keep building privacy solutions Because at the end of the day as I've said before privacy to me is a human right we all have a right to Privacy and we shouldn't lose our right to that and we shouldn't be able to not use the tools such as tornado cache Just because criminals use it because at the end of the day criminals use end-to-end encrypted messaging, too But you know that's not banned they tried to ban it at one point and governments around the world Some of them have banned it, but at the end of the day the u.s. Hasn't right Maybe I hope they don't ever ban it, but they haven't right now And people use it and it's very easily accessible so the same should be true for our financial activity on Networks like aetherium we should be able to get full privacy of our transactions now. That's the optimistic thing That's kind of like me saying that we should be able to we should be able to get these things But there is unfortunately something that happened over the weekend that with Aztec Network that saddened me So Aztec I believe the most of the Aztec team or at least the founders definitely are based in the UK They're not based in the US But because the UK is part of that five eyes of the five eyes organization that I talked about last week Aztec protocol is still at the mercy of something like the tornado cash sanctions or something like the US now They put out this thread where they said we are aware of reports that FTX is warning users not to interact with Aztec as a result we want to underscore our current and ongoing risk reduction framework To implement practical deterrence and measure their effectiveness And then they go on to the thread about what they're doing here now the most concerning thing to me here And I don't necessarily blame Aztec for this I blame obviously the poor regulations for this But the most concerning thing to me is this tweet here, so where is the tweet where it's? God where is the tweet? I think it's this one So this is what they're going to be implementing on the Aztec networks system-wide daily asset deposit caps IP specific deposit rate limiting single address pending deposit caps and constraints on the escape hatch window Activating only in case of aliveness failure the reason why I find this to be Really bad is because all this does is punish the regular user Every single person that wants to use privacy tools as a criminal to do money laundering to evade sanctions is Going to get around each of these relatively easily especially on a network like that is actually decentralized like aetherium That's why I said the tornado cash sanctions don't make much sense because North Korea or whoever Wasn't using the front end right anyone who wanted to have Anyone who wanted to launder money anyone who wanted to kind of like evade sanctions was not using the front end They were using the immutable smart contracts on aetherium that still exists today. Tornado cash is still in operation That wasn't taken down so all that happened is that they've punished regular users And then they've also introduced this chilling effect where everyone is so scared now to build support Privacy solutions, they're so scared that they're going above and Beyond What's required of the sanctions and blocking people who even are even just kind of like one degree of separation away from these addresses From the from the tornado cash addresses And it's led to that big chilling effect there and the chilling effect has now hit Aztec which is really really sad because I love Aztec I mean disclosure. I'm an I'm an investor in Aztec, but I mean I not surprised by this I'm just extremely disappointed that it's come to this I Understand why they have to do it But at the end of the day like we really do need to keep building these solutions We need to build them as anons we need to build them in a decentralized way And I know it's really easy for me Someone who is both not a us citizen and is not building any of these solutions to say this But I mean I guess like I'm in that position to be able to say it like I know a lot of these teams can't Say because they're building it they don't want to be doing this that I want to be putting in these restrictions Most of them if not all of them are building these solutions to kind of get you know Give people privacy and give them something that they believe is a right, but they're being forced the hands are being forced yet They are not anonymous people. They are based in jurisdictions that have extradition treaties with the us They're not going to just I guess like ignore the sanctions. They're not going to Be I guess willy-nilly about this They're going to be very conservative especially if they have lawyers breathing down their necks saying hey if you don't do this There is a risk you're going to jail for 30 years like I Think people are being very harsh on these people that have to comply I think what should be happening is that instead of going after these people that are complying With these sorts of things and then going above and beyond as well, which I think is stupid, but it happens We should be fighting the regulations themselves, so anyway I'm going to leave that at that you can go read this whole Aztec thread for a breakdown of this year But I just thought it was quite sad and disappointing that and not surprising that Aztec has to go down this path now but that's the reality of the situation right now and finally on the I guess censorship resistant front we have Mallos here with a thread about The there's a chart here that shows the current state of a theorem daps and d phy and areas where we excel and others where? Points of failure exist which I think is a really really good chart because you can see here. What is sensorable what is unknown trusted and mutably mutable experiences And what is censorship resistant and provably trusted and this basically takes? My layered approach to what is kind of like sensible and what is not and I guess it maps it out here So you can see on the far right side there is sensitive resistant and provably trusted Things such as the unisop smart contract is immutable can't be tampered with can't be changed even by governance, right? Whereas on the other side on the left side you have sensible such as the unisop front end or the other front end or a generic Kind of a front end very very sensible shouldn't expect any censorship resistance from that at all And then you have all these other entities here. I'll link this in the description for you to check out I'm not going to go over all of it here, but there's also a thread that accompanies it as well And it breaks it all down, so I highly recommend giving the thread a read I will link it there for you And just going to get through the rest of these cuz I'm going over time here So I've been seeing a lot of people talk about a theorem layer one activity lately and how it's like at rock bottom and gas Prices are really cheap. You know that's totally fine obviously It's come down a lot from the bull market But I don't think it makes sense to just look at layer one activity and and and that and and that's it you need to Start accounting for layer two activity because there is actually a lot of layer two activity these days on Optimism on Arbitrum on these other layer two networks out there You need to look at that activity and pair that with a theorem layer one to get a more accurate View of what's happening on the network now people will say well layer twos aren't really paying much to layer one in gas fees I'm like yeah, okay They aren't and they're probably going to be paying even less once 48 44 comes into play But that's not the point the point is that their activity is moving or at least some of the activities moving from layer one to layer Two so we should be taking it in aggregate and also layer one gas fees as soon as the bull market comes back in earnest guys Layer one gas fees are shooting right back up like there's no way they're going to stay at these levels when the market gets hot again It's just the way it is now You know long long term will we have gas fees still kind of like high on layer one I I think we will as long as we get these breakout applications that we all hope we'll get Especially on these layer twos But in the current world or at least for the next couple years as soon as the market gets hot the gas fees go up It's pretty much like in correlation with each other But at the same time there are people moving from layer one to layer two so we should look at layer two metrics and And kind of like pair them with layer one instead of just looking at layer one there And to add on to that there is kind of like a tweet from orbiter finance today that basically showed some of this So you can see here the top five roll-ups with the most new accounts in the last seven days It's the Albatrom optimism the Albatrom one optimism Albatrom Nova Stark net and zk-sync and you can see all the numbers here of that So this is what I mean tracking transactions tracking new accounts tracking TVL I mean obviously TVL is one of my most hated metrics But it's still relevant to you know in some capacity tracking fear of a new tracking smart contracts deployed right tracking interactions with the contracts all that sorts of stuff should be taken as well as the layer one metrics and put together and Compared with all of that rather than just taking layer one and in that vein of thinking as well You shouldn't just take layer two in as a vacuum either You should kind of like compare it all together to get the full etherium network transactional activity there All right last up here We have a thread from astaria looking at The astaria three actor model and what that means for the future of NFT lending so you can go check out this thread I just wanted to put it on your radar because I know Recently there's been a bit of discussion about NFT lending especially because I think we saw like a liquidation Cascade on board a on the board a be up club So I kind of recommend reading this some this right here for how her star is targeting NFT lending or tackling NFT lending It's going to be a big thing I don't think that just because one protocol failed will mean that others fail. I think NFTs obviously a big right now I'm going to continue to grow and people want liquidity on it I mean at the end of the day NFTs don't have to be just your random profile pictures NFTs or anything like that Eventually NFTs will be people's deed to their houses And then you could potentially put that up as collateral on something like astaria and borrow against it Just like you would put it up as collateral in a bank to borrow against it, right? So it's all about not just NFT profile picture stuff that we're seeing today But anything that is a unique item that you can put up as collateral can be done through platforms like astaria But I think on that note that's going to be it for today So thank everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet Give it a thumbs up subscribe to newsletter join the discord channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow.

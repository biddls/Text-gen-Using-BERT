 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the dailygue refuel where we cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host the Anthony's a signer and today's the 2nd of March 2022 Everyone let's get into it So I put out a tweet today where I said if you don't want centralized exchanges to freeze your assets There is one simple solution withdraw your assets to your own wallet preferably a hardware wallet the ability to self custody digital assets is One of the most amazing innovations of crypto take advantage of it now I put out this tweet because of all of the I guess kind of like things we've been seeing with regards to funds being frozen Not just in crypto, but without of it obviously there was the stuff with the Canadian truckers a few weeks ago And lately there's been the stuff with the the sanctions in in Russia and stuff like that So I think that I'm not making any kind of like Moral case here any judgments or any kind of like foreign against here But if you keep your assets in a centralized place it it opens it up to them being sent to them being frozen Sorry and on top of that if you use centralized assets like a centralized stable coin such as USDC or USDT You are opened up to them being frozen as well So in that kind of like instance It's not well You know I mean if you have USDC on a centralized exchange and you withdraw it to your own wallet it may just be marginally better But it's not really that much better I mean you're still holding an asset that can be frozen by a circle at any time that they want to freeze it so I Guess like this risk there now The assets that I'm talking about here are the true kind of like self custody assets such as ETH On the ethereum network and BTC on the Bitcoin network and a bunch of assets on aetherium obviously tokens and stuff like that So keeping them on centralized exchanges or any kind of material amount on centralized exchanges Especially if you're just holding them in cold storage and not actively training them is definitely not a great thing to do not just because of the risk of them being frozen or the risk of them kind of like being hacked or Or I guess kind of like or the exchange kind of losing access to them But also their risk of just in general kind of like not not the exchange itself freezing it but kind of like you getting caught in the crosshairs of things because There are different reasons the exchange will freeze your assets One of them will be in response to law enforcement right if you if they suspect you of doing some something wrong They'll freeze your assets. We won't be able to move them They'll basically make your kind of like account worthless until they restore access at some undefined period in the future Secondly they might freeze them as part of their compliance effort, so they might might say hey You know we're just doing compliance efforts We need you to provide some additional information until you do this your assets are frozen And then there's a you know possibly a bunch of other reasons that they would freeze your assets there But they do have the ability to do that and they it's because they're technically their assets They just give me they've just given you an IOU They're basically giving you a promise that when you go to withdraw those assets to your own address. They'll honor that Withdrawal, but while your assets are in the centralized exchange they own the keys to it You do not own the keys to it so your assets are as good as theirs and not yours yes There may be some legal protections here and things like that But they are normally not great to rely on and take a lot longer to play out and could take potentially years to play out For you to get your assets back in case of a hack or in case of things being frozen or kind of like you may Never get it back and obviously people who had their assets in MT Gox Kind of like very familiar with that it's going on spot seven eight years now where those assets have as far as I know not Been returned yet, so that's a very very long time obviously It's a good thing for people since back then because it's a majority But it's BTC and BTC has gone up a lot since then But these people don't know if they're getting all of it back when they're getting it back all that sort of stuff Right so that's just one example there And you know as I said in the tweet like take advantage of the fact that we have this amazing thing or these amazing innovation in crypto Well we can truly have self custody over our assets because when you think about the existing financial system What assets do you have true self custody over right? Really at the end of the day I guess the only thing you could argue that you have true self custody over is cash right But cash is kind of useless in this day and age because you can't use cash in a digitally native way if you want to use cash in the digital world You have to deposit that cash into a bank the centralized intermediary And then the bank will issue you some you know digits in your bank account that represent the cash that you have in the bank and they'll be like okay well now you can use the digital payments infrastructure now you can use MasterCard Visa whatever whatever it is to do your digital payments That's not a digitally native payments infrastructure that is just a kind of like band-aid on an existing system that was never created or existing monetary system that was never created for the digital digital world Whereas crypto was created for the digital world because it is digitally native it does not exist as a physical thing of course you can print out a private key on a piece of paper and argue that that's physical ETH but it's not right because the ETH only exists in cyberspace it exists on the blockchain it exists on the internet and it is digitally native Now because of that you get true custody over your ETH in your own ethereum wallet you don't have to put it in a centralized intermediary in order to turn it digital it is digital which means that everything that you can do with digital payments in the traditional system you can now do once the integrations kind of like come online further down the adoption cycle you can now do in a completely self custodial and decentralized way This is the key innovation of crypto this is the biggest thing in crypto this is the biggest innovation in money in you know thousands tens of thousands of years this is what we should all be very excited about so given that kind of reality there you should really be securing your own assets I know that some people don't like to do it because they don't trust themselves and that's exactly why banks came around too right because securing a lot of cash is both kind of like physically cumbersome but also kind of like mentally draining because you have to worry about security but when it comes to the digital world I mean you have a hardware wallet and you can store as much crypto as you want on that hardware wallet whether it's you know a thousand dollars a million dollars a billion dollars it's the same thing it's just digitally native money It's not like cash where you know storing a thousand dollars of cash is easy storing a million dollars of cash is difficult still doable in your own home storing a billion dollars of cash forget about it like it's just so cumbersome to transport it to count it like in every I mean I don't have to go through the reasons right you can imagine a billion dollars worth of cash and a billion dollars worth of ETH what's easier to keep track of and count and use I mean you guys know the answer right So from that perspective I think that no matter you know what amount you have in crypto if it's a material amount and by material amount I mean if it's a large percentage of your overall net worth and you're just holding it as a as kind of like a long term hold there's no point keeping it on a centralized exchange in my opinion you should keep it in your own hardware wallet self custody do everything from a hardware wallet whether that be a ledger or a lattice one and you know even just in your own kind of like wallet is better than a centralized exchange even if it's a hot wallet Now I obviously don't recommend putting large sums of money into a hot wallet but it's still marginally better than a centralized exchange but of course you're going to be responsible for your own custody responsible for securing those assets securing your seed phrase securing your hardware devices but you know in my opinion for most people for the majority of people like the you know 99% of people that is much better than keeping it on a centralized exchange I do realize that there are a lot of kind of I guess like bigger players out there who legally have to keep it on a centralized exchange and there are bigger players out there who are targeted in kind of like a tax to just to steal their crypto which is you know totally reasonable to kind of like secure it I guess like on a centralized service but as an individual as kind of like regular individual it doesn't pay to have your assets on centralized exchanges in my opinion And obviously not all centralized exchanges are created equal, assets on Coinbase are much safer than assets on an offshore exchange for example or assets on one of the smaller kind of like centralized exchanges but you know we have a long list of incidents on the centralized exchanges over the years that it should kind of like get you to just store your assets yourself and not even just not even just for security reasons but also for the fact that you can actually do it You can actually do it in a digitally native truly self cost custody and decentralized way which we've never had the ability to do so before whether it be kind of like crypto assets or cash or kind of like monetary assets or whether it be things like collectibles I mean you can do with NFTs which is obviously very awesome as well So I just wanted to kind of give a bit of a spiel about that for you guys but you guys know that I'm a big proponent of self custody if you're comfortable doing so if you're not fine keep it on a centralized exchange but just realize that by doing so you open yourself up to additional risk And if that risk is kind of like less risk to you than securing your own assets on your own well that's your prerogative the beautiful thing is that you have a choice right it's not like the physical cash world where I guess the physical financial system where you can't actually do anything with your cash in the digital world unless you put it into a centralized intermediary you don't have the choice there so yeah I think that's one of the coolest innovations of crypto and I hope that more people take advantage of it Alright so onto some core developer updates so Alex Stokes announced EIP 4863 which is a new EIP for beacon chain withdrawals called beacon chain push withdrawals and as Alex describes it here this EIP provides an alternative to the pool based flow that offers tight integration with the core protocol So if you want to read the full EIP you can do so it will link in the YouTube description it's kind of like not a long read there's a bunch of kind of like discussions going back and forth about it too already between a bunch of the core devs and core researchers which is really cool to see But yeah in layman's terms this is potentially the EIP that will go into the Shanghai update which will enable withdrawals of staked ETH and of rewards kind of like in the ETH kind of like beacon chain as well so obviously this needs to be done But as I've said before it's probably going to happen about six months after the merge so we may see it later this year if not early next year and as I've said before there is not going to be a mass withdrawal of ETH guys there is a validator queue which means there is a limit to how much ETH can be withdrawn each day And as I've said before I believe that limit to be around 30,000 ETH roughly each day which is a far cry from the 10 million plus ETH that is staked it's not like there's going to be 8 million ETH withdrawn all at once and just dumped on market that's not how this stuff works guys And the funny thing is there's a kind of like a few million ETH there that exists as RE ETH and ST ETH and a bunch of other liquid staking as well that can be sold at kind of like any time at this point so I think that a lot of people who are staking their ETH plan to do so for a long time plan to just sell their rewards So from that perspective you know I just anyone who kind of goes on about these mass unlocks and things like that they just don't know what they're talking about right but anyway off track there a little bit definitely go check out this EIP it will be linked in the YouTube description below Alright so Trent Van Apps has another tweet to add to his thread that I spoke about yesterday to add to his kind of like tweets that he's talking about with regards to the merge so this is number 5 where he says to any stakers you should start running a local execution layer client ahead of the merge because in the future outsourcing this to third party providers will open up stakers to slashing risk under proof of custody under the proof of custody game and you can read this blog post from Dan Cradd about this here and about this what this means for you So in layman's terms if you are a solo staker and right now you're running an Ethereum 2 or a consensus layer client and beacon node whether that be prism lighthouse nimbus teku whatever it is and then you're outsourcing the Ethereum 1 node or the execution layer node to a third party such as Infura or alchemy or my crypto or anything like that Doing this in the future opens you up to the slashing risk so you should be running your own local execution layer eth1 client full node whether that be geth nethermind and a bunch of the other ones out there I run kind of like nethermind and geth I like to run both of them so I'm running my own client there it does require you to have a bit more extra solid state drive space on your staking box if you're a solo staker but it shouldn't be too much I mean as I said before solid state drives are relatively cheap These days especially compared to hard drives and if you want to future proof yourself you should probably even just get a couple of solid state drives have one running your beacon node and your validator one being home to your execution layer I guess node or eth1 node And you're all well and good and a couple of 2 terabyte drives not very expensive these days in the SSD realm and then you're kind of like set for I guess I would say many years at that point right I don't imagine you needing much more than that And if you're a solo staker the rewards that you'd be getting would be more than enough to cover the cost of that too and it's just the cost of doing business at the end of the day it's not like you have an ongoing cost of electricity and hardware and having to upgrade the hardware all the time This hardware can be future proofed for quite a while so yeah I'm just a really great tweet from Trent here and the blog post that he links to will of course be linked in the youtube description Alright so a huge announcement out of Arbitrum over the last 24 hours it seems to have flown under the radar a bit so Arbitrum have announced something called AnyTrustChains which is an Arbitrum mode for ultra low cost transactions with strong security guarantees AnyTrustChains will operate alongside Arbitrum 1 so I guess the explain like I'm 5 is that AnyTrustChains is Arbitrums answer to Validium, ZK Porter and even things like Avac subnets and stuff like that So the reason I say this and I think it's actually more secure than the Avac subnets but the reason I say this is because what Validium and ZK Porter do is that they take the data off chain off the Ethereum main chain and kind of like put it into a kind of committee And that committee is responsible for securing the data and I've talked about this before right guys where you have off chain data on chain transaction proofs and you have much better security than a traditional side chain or something like an Avac subnets But you don't have kind of like the full security of a roll up but you still have really really great security but the benefit is that you get much cheaper transactions So in this blog post Arbitrum details that these kind of like things these AnyTrustChains are really good for lower value stuff just like how Avalidium is used for immutable X for lower value stuff like NFTs And just like how ZK Porter is going to come around from ZK Sync to do this as well, this is Arbitrums kind of like answer to that And the funny thing is that AnyTrustChains were Arbitrums original construction in 2018 so it's kind of like come full circle here which is really really cool to see And this was a huge announcement I mean I'd always wondered kind of like what I guess optimistic roll up teams were going to do to answer the things like Validiums and ZK Porters and just off chain data in general And it seems that the off chain labs has an answer to this with AnyTrustChains Now I wonder if optimism is going to do something similar maybe they will maybe they won't but it's really really great to see that off chain labs is pushing this kind of like world where they envision Arbitrum 1 as their main optimistic roll up that's fully secured by Ethereum That they're kind of like putting all their resources behind as a centralized team but also giving the option for people to launch their own Arbitrum chains like Arbitrum 1 But also launch something like an AnyTrustChain which is a cheaper and faster kind of like L2 chain with minimal trust assumptions but just not as secure as a roll up So very very cool to see this you can go read this blog post to get a full breakdown of what this kind of like all is And you know I should mention there's also a fallback to roll up mode as well so this is like what I guess Starkware wants to do with their Validium They want to turn it into, man I can't remember the name of it right now but they want to turn it into this as well where you can fall back to roll up mode 2 Where you can still post that data to the Ethereum L1 chain and withdrawals will have the usual delay period just like the standard roll up So very cool to see this you know I think this is where the tokens start making a lot of sense because you want some way to secure the committee You want to give the community the incentive to keep kind of like processing transactions to keep themselves online to keep the data available And what better way to do that than having a token like you can pay them out token rewards you can have it so that they have to stake the token in order to get those rewards And you're just kind of like adding crypto economics into the mix here so I think you know as I said before like all these L2s are going to have tokens But I was curious how some of them would actually kind of integrate them with their existing systems or you know integrating with their ecosystem And I can see this happening you know and maybe it's a thing where these antitrust chains decide to be their own kind of like thing Where they're like okay well I don't want to use the Arbitrum token I want to use my own token and that's totally possible too But we're going to have to see how that all plays out as well there but very very cool to see this new construction from Arbitrum Just another option for people to play around with just another thing on the Ethereum scalability belt right there's so much going on in Ethereum scalability right now guys It's absolutely insane like I've lost track of it at this point like as I said the other day like just looking at what's happening on StarkNet alone As an ecosystem is very cool and that's still very early but then looking at Arbitrum and Optimism and Polygon and all this other stuff and stuff and ZKSync Good luck keeping up with it anymore guys that's all I can say you're going to need maybe like 20 refills a day just to keep up with it Unfortunately I can't talk for 10 hours a day guys I'm sorry but yeah you'll I think this is good I think this is just the way things are going to be from now on I think the coolest things that come out will be the biggest things and we'll probably hear about it but it's going to be like trying to keep up with the internet You know at this stage trying to get up with L2 stuff but definitely go check out the blog post I'll link it in the YouTube description Alright so a new protocol as I was just saying I'm finding it difficult to keep up with everything but this is one that came across my radar Called ZK-Lend which is a money market protocol that is going to be native to StarkNet combining ZK rollup scalability, superior transaction speed and cost savings with Ethereum security So they're coming out of stealth over the last 24 hours and there's a blog post here that you can kind of like read all about kind of what they're doing They also have a TLDR where they're saying they're tearing down the old guard, tearing down the issues of DeFi market makers Enter ZK-Lend, sneak peek into Artemis and Apollo which is assuming kind of like their version names for their kind of protocol here So what they mean by tearing down the old guard is that they've got four key things that they're kind of trying to target here So privacy, so borrowers no longer need to disclose their identity when borrowing because loans are over collateralized and held in smart contracts Custody, both sides hold their own assets, fairness, everyone is entitled to the same pools and rates that they wish to participate in And transparency information around each pool supply, demand and interest is clearly stated upfront and enforced on chain I think a few of these things are only possible especially privacy is really only possible because it's being built on the layer 2 StarkNet instead of layer 1 Ethereum So again guys this is one of those things that I talked about that when I said that there are a lot of things that can only be done on layer 2s and not on layer 1 Ethereum as well Highly recommend giving this full blog post a read to check out what's kind of like going on here and what they're kind of like building But yeah as I said this is going to be on StarkNet, this is really really cool I mean StarkNet having a money market coming so early to the ecosystem is obviously very great As I said before there are a few key apps that each ecosystem needs to have Obviously one of them, or the top one being an AMM or just like a decentralized exchange I would argue the second one being a money market because those two things together enable all the other apps to come and kind of like exist on the chain And actually get usage and be able to compose with each other and interoperate with each other Because they're like the core primitives of DeFi at the end of the day So very cool to see this, very cool to see that it's just not another kind of like fork of like Aave or a fork of Compound or Frokafide or anything else It's something new, something native to StarkNet, not being deployed on L1 Something to get excited about, looking forward to learning more about ZK Lend as time progresses So Hayden Adams from Uniswap put out a tweet today saying that you can now convert any token to ETH and directly donate to Ukraine in a single transaction on donate.uniswap.org This is really cool, like no matter your views on this whole thing or whether you think it's right to donate to the Ukraine war effort or not I think what this shows is just how quickly capital can be formed, capital can be kind of pulled together in crypto But also how we can do one click things like convert the ETH, sorry convert any of your existing tokens into ETH and donate it to Ukraine in a single transaction To do something like this with the traditional system, let me kind of like spell it out to you and how slow it would be If you wanted to sell one of your stocks or shares for example for an asset to donate, say for like dollars to donate to one of these efforts You would have to liquidate the stock and there may be a kind of like time limit on being able to sell that There's no AMMs to sell it into, right, you can sell it into the open market but depending on the liquidity, depending on what stock it is, blah blah all that sort of stuff I mean it's similar in crypto but with AMMs it kind of like levels it up But you have to sell it, then you have to get that money, right, and then there's a risk that you're probably going to get that money put on hold or something Because depending on who you're with they're not going to credit you the money straight away You're going to have to withdraw it out of your kind of brokerage account into your normal bank account That might take 24 hours, blah blah, right, so you're already at kind of like all this friction just to do this And then you want to donate it to Ukraine, well maybe your bank blocks you from doing that Maybe your bank blocks these kind of things from going on, yeah obviously Ukraine is not the one that's sanctioned, Russia is But maybe your bank's like well no we don't want you doing this, banks can do that, right, that's why we hate banks, right, because they can do that Now compare it to what we have here with Uniswap You have your digitally native tokens on Ethereum, you convert it to ETH and you send the money to the Ukraine government's Ethereum address all in one transaction Takes two seconds guys, I mean at most it's going to take one Ethereum block to do this Maybe if you've got multiple tokens you want to do, it's going to take a bit Obviously the fees are going to be quite a little bit high because this is being done on layer one But ignoring the fees for a second here and just talking about the speed of what you can do Within five minutes, not even, if you've got like 10, 15 different tokens you want to convert You can convert them all into ETH and each transaction will just kind of like go into the Ukraine government all in kind of like one thing there, done All from the comfort of your kind of like own home, all from the comfort of doing it in a self-custodial way as well Not having to rely on centralized institutions, zero chance of your assets being kind of like frozen or near zero chance of your assets being frozen in your own Ethereum wallet obviously There's always the slight chance that the Ethereum becomes under attack but you know, that's just kind of like getting too into the weeds there This is what crypto kind of like enables and what's so powerful about it On top of the self-custody stuff that I was talking about earlier, it's so powerful that we can kind of like do capital formation like this in an incredibly quick way In a global way too, this isn't just cross state lines or in the same kind of like, in the same country so to speak This is all over the world, this is someone in Australia for example because Australia is kind of far away from everything Being able to use a protocol that was developed by a US based team that exists on Ethereum which is a global network And send these assets to Ukraine which is not close to Australia right, like it's in obviously in Europe, definitely not close to Australia And I can do this all from the comfort of my own study, all in 10 minutes or less, all without having to worry to kind of like interact with any centralized institutions And I get to make my own decisions with my own money, this is absolutely awesome, as I said one of the key innovations on top of what I was talking about earlier But yeah, I just wanted to kind of like highlight that for you guys and definitely go use it if you want to donate to Ukraine Maybe put some of those shitcoins that are burning a hole in your wallet to use because in most countries donations are also a tax write off So you may be able to kind of like swing something there with all of those coins that are just burning a hole in your wallet because they're down so much Maybe you want to write them off as a loss and help a good cause while you're doing it, you can do that too right And another thing got to do with Uniswap was a tweet from Fidi Basta today who said The Uniswap effect, Uniswap launched on Polygon on the 21st of December 2021, it only took 21 days to become the first DEX by trading volume on Polygon This is what I've talked about before about Uniswap's brand and kind of like trust and just overall awareness being so so much bigger than everything else in crypto in the AMM space Nothing comes close, 1inch, Balancer, Clipper, Quickswap, SushiSwap, they're known to an extent I mean 1inch is obviously very popular, Balancer, SushiSwap, Quickswap a bit less popular in terms of like overall crypto and Clipper I mean obviously you can see from the volume shake here not very popular But in terms of like crypto as a whole and the mindshare as a whole and what people have heard of before Pretty much everyone in crypto that's ever used anything on chain has probably heard of Uniswap right Or one of its derivatives too like PancakeSwap, a lot of people use that I guess like back in the day during the mania And that's why I've said before that like Uniswap's dominance is not going away anytime soon Doesn't matter if other protocols are better in some way or offer something better or whatever else Their dominance is here to stay for a lot of different reasons but awareness and trust and security is a big one People should be using aggregators because it's cheaper but they don't because they just trust the Uniswap more They're more aware of Uniswap, they just kind of like it's better to go through Uniswap than it is to go through an aggregator for them So yeah I just wanted to kind of like highlight this that Uniswap really is just still absolutely kicking ass in the centralised exchange space Alright so I just wanted to quickly highlight a thread from Stone Cold Pat here who basically starts this thread off by saying EIP-1559 is one of the most important upgrades ever, it guarantees a security budget for block producers, no instability at the tip It makes gas prices predictable for the user and it allows the network to temporarily handle burst traffic and not always run at max capacity Now I've talked about this in the past many many many times before so I'm not going to harp on about this now But Pat goes into a lot more detail in his thread here about each of these points so I definitely highly recommend giving it a read And I like threads like this because there was a large cohort of people for quite a while that were kind of like Fighting 1559 after it went live saying that it increased gas costs, that it's bad for the network blah blah blah And in reality what increased gas costs was the NFT mania, I mean we've seen gas go into the 20s, the 20s ways lately And that's because on-chain activity is down a lot right, as opposed to kind of like what it was previously So I think reading this thread from Pat gives a lot of great insights into that and I mean at this point in time it's objective that 1559 Kind of like was good for the network and achieved all of its goals and even worked to lower gas fees by about 7 or 8% across the board By making the gas fees more kind of like stable and making it so people didn't have to overpay as well So very very cool to see that, I'll link this in the YouTube description for you to give the thread a read Alright finally here we have Tally Cash with an update that you can now swap tokens inside your Tally wallet So all fees go straight to the community multisig and Tally swaps are almost half the cost of MetaMask So this is obviously similar to MetaMask swaps that they have inside the MetaMask wallet But now if you're using the Tally wallet you can just go to the swap interface and do the same thing as MetaMask I just wanted to highlight this for you guys out there that are using Tally This is just another alternative to MetaMask which I'm sure maybe some of you are using It's not very popular compared to MetaMask yet because it's relatively new But it's cool that there's already a swap feature in there and as it says it's cheaper than MetaMask here But yeah just wanted to highlight that for you guys, any of you guys using it And definitely go give Tally a try if you haven't yet I've tried it on Chrome before but I'm still using MetaMask obviously because I trust MetaMask more And it kind of acts weird sometimes with other wallets if you have both installed and stuff like that So I had to remove Tally but yeah definitely cool to see this and go check it out if you haven't yet But I think on that note I'm going to end it there for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching Be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet Give the video a thumbs up Subscribe to the newsletter Join the Discord channel And I'll catch you all tomorrow Thanks everyone

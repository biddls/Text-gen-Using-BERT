 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the deadly gray refuel where we cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host danther tisano and today's the 22nd of february 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it So one of crypto's most I guess like prevailing mysteries is who is the identity or what is the identity of the ethereum? 2016 dow hacker now for those of you who don't know The dow was kind of like one of the first icos in 2016 on ethereum This kind of like big initiative to basically pull a bunch of e's together and then invest that e as part of the dow in Other projects now this uh kind of like dow was just called the dow also issued tokens dow tokens to people who put their eath In so, you know, it was pretty much like a classical ico here now this um Dow managed to attract a lot of eath like I mean a lot of eath. I think uh, it was uh, 20 percent or something of all eath in existence at the time or something crazy like that Probably probably more than that and and it basically drove eath's price up as well to I think like 25 dollars at the time during 2016 from around uh five or ten dollars. So it was a huge deal I mean, it was the biggest thing that had happened in ethereum's history to that point Yeah, ethereum was was quite young and it only been around since mid 2015 But uh, it was a big deal now what ended up happening is that there was a bug in the dow A smart contract that allowed a hacker to kind of like exploit it and withdraw funds in into a kind of like holding account Which after 30 days would have allowed the hacker to withdraw this eath and keep the eath now, of course what ended up happening was that the community decided to Do what was called an irregular state transition to fix that bug and take the eath away from the hacker and basically return it To everyone and then there was a fork in the chain and ethereum, you know Continued on as the fork chain known known as ethereum and the quote-unquote original chain existed as ethereum classic So there was a bit of a divide in the community there and the rest is history Now, uh, laura shin here claims that she's been able to find out the identity of the dow hacker now I'll take this with a grain of salt because this thread that she's put out here She's really just promoting her new book I mean there are like three quarters of the thread is literally links to her new book and links to her podcast and everything like That I mean not necessarily a bad thing or anything, but you know It is obviously kind of like a marketing pr strategy for her book, which just came out But the expert the excerpt from the book here is basically or at least um, uh, i'm not sure whether it's from the book Or from somewhere else that darren has actually shared here says that the dow hacker appears to be toby Uh, hohenish. I don't know if that's how you say he's um, his last name Who is a 36 year old programmer who grew up in austria and was living in singapore at the time of the hack Until now he has been best known for his role as a co-founder and ceo of 10x 10x turned out to be a scam. I'm pretty sure um, which is funny enough but 10x raised 80 million dollars in a 2017 ico to build a crypto debit card an effort that failed the market cap of those tokens Which spiked at 535 million now sits at just 11 million and yeah 10x is one of those tokens that just got obliterated during The last bear market there. So look Take it with a grain of salt Like I haven't seen all the evidence or anything like that like that this literally just came out like 10 minutes before I started recording I saw this and I wanted to mention it on the refill today But i'm gonna wait and say let this kind of like cook for the next 24 48 hours see who comes forward with more and more evidence See what kind of evidence there actually is and see kind of like the og is corroborating his story Because I mean accusing someone so publicly of being like a high-profile hacker You wouldn't want to do this unless you were like really sure it was the person because this person can hit back and basically sue Laura for uh for doing this right, um, depending on what jurisdiction I mean, I know in australia We have pretty strict kind of like libel laws. You can pretty much do that But yeah, just generally you want to be very very sure uh before you kind of like make these kind of claims So from what i've just seen so far in the last, you know, 10 15 minutes I saw a couple people on twitter a couple of ethereum og's comment on this saying that it looks credible It looks legit, but i'm not going to say that this is 100 percent, you know Correct, and then toby is actually the dow hacker if he is I mean cool We actually have a lot of people who are like, you know, who are like, you know, who are like, you know, who are like Who are like, you know, who are like, you know, who are like, you know, who are like, you know, who are like Who are like, you know, who are like, you know, who are like, you know, who are like, you know, who are like, you know, who are like, you know, who are like, you know, who are like who are like I mean cool As I said, it's one of the crypto's longest prevailing mysteries And the other one was the bitfinex hacker as darren mentioned here who we saw You know the last couple weeks kind of get unmasked there which also happened in 2016 around the same time So quite funny how that kind of like worked out as well But um, yeah, I just wanted to highlight this for you guys You can go check out Laura's thread which as I said like most of it's just links to her books There's not much information there I think you check out this tweet from Darren as I just read out to it They'll both be linked in the YouTube description But if anything kind of like happens around this over the next 24 48 hours I'll definitely cover it on I guess like the the the next refills that I do but yeah for now I guess you'll probably see a lot about this on Twitter Maybe even by the time you watch this it's already kind of like blown up on Twitter, which I'm sure it will be so so yeah Alright, so I put out this tweet today. I was just kind of sitting on my computer I was looking at the eighth chart, and I'm just like man like the price This is not want to go up right now, and then I put out this treat where I said It really does feel like 2019 again There's an insane amount of good crypto news, and I've covered all of it on the refuel I mean not maybe not all of it, but like a lot of it on the refuel There's just like so much good news coming out pretty much every single day. That is extremely positive for crypto Conferences are packed with actual builders You know the eighth Denver conference that just happened was the biggest eighth Denver ever One of the biggest crypto conferences ever over 15,000 people in attendance I think the short-term quote unquote moon boys are gone So like the short-term speculators most of them are completely gone like they're they're definitely not hanging around When pretty much all the things that they bought are down like you know 70 80 percent And the market just isn't reacting positively to any of it, and then I finished a tweet by saying you know Just keep building and stacking we all know what happened in 2020 now I mean this is like Twitter doesn't give you unlimited characters here So that's why I like adding nuance to it on the refuel look I mean 2019 like none of us thought that 2020 was gonna be as big as it was and especially not 2021 like we were hanging around you know I remember I was very active in 2019 at conferences like pretty much went to As many conferences as I could there I mean the amount of people there was was was was very tiny compared to what you see today And it was it was like the depths of the bear market. He had basically come off its high 1400 It was hanging around one to three hundred dollars just ranging and any kind of like pumps that we ever saw We're just sold down and and I think at that point people kind of like just got over that like whatever the price is gonna Do what it's gonna do let's just focus on on the building what we're doing here like the first signs of d5 We're coming out everyone was really excited about that, and it was all kind of like happening there the conferences were awesome I mean like the people the energy was just insane. I really missed that But like I'm obviously looking forward to to getting around that this year But then 2020 happened, and it was a weird year right like 2020 happened We had that massive crash in March and everyone was like what what the hell like what the hell like we just went through a Brutal 2019 and now we're going through you know a lot of brutality here And if you actually go look at the chart January February really positive months for crypto It felt like the bull market was back And then we got that just one last kind of like stabbed down to $80 or $90 I think it was for eighth and then we continued back up from there and ended the year at about $700 and then within a month we were back at all-time high in January 2021 so very interesting yeah But not something that anyone expected and that's why I said we all know what happened in 2020 now Does that mean that we're gonna go through like a bearish period in 2022 where the price isn't really gonna do anything Positive it might just keep trending down and then 2023 is gonna be the explosive year where everything goes gangbusters again I don't know like I mean obviously I don't know but all I know is that as long as the builders are still around as Long as they're still really really cool things being being deployed to mainnet as long as there's lots of positive news happening I just have no reason to to be bearish here And you know I was kind of like discussing this in the disco channel today And I was saying that people were like kind of wondering like why are we coming down like why are we actually? In a quote-unquote bear market or in like a downtrend well Let's contextualize it March 2020 eats $80 May 2021 It is $4,400 that is over a 40x increase in 14 months Now whenever the markets and it wasn't the only asset that went up obviously a lot of assets went up Now whenever that happens in the markets There's never enough liquidity out there to absorb the enormous amount of paper gains that people have Made in a short amount of time and as soon as the market starts coming down again people want to sell people want to protect Their paper gains and there's also leverage in the mix too Which just amplifies the whole thing because people leverage up way too much at the top right and get way too greedy And it leads to that epic drop we saw in like a week from 4400 to 1700 that was one of the most brutal drops in crypto's history For eighth and obviously doesn't just apply to either applies to everything else We also saw a lot of craziness around those coins starting in Jan Feb and people were like oh This is a top signal, but we didn't top until May so it's really hard to kind of like pinpoint those those tops and bottoms But at the same time if an asset goes up over 40x in 14 months obviously a lot of people are gonna be sitting a lot Of profit they're gonna want to take that profit and as I said there is never ever enough liquidity out there to to service everyone And that's why a lot of the smartest investors I know if they want to scale out of a position they'll sell on the way up They won't even care if they don't you know sell at the top or anything like that if it's in a really strong uptrend They're gonna be selling into that because they know that eventually music is gonna stop and it's gonna come down much faster than what it went up and because Obviously fear is more powerful than greed here now obviously that is hard to do It is not something that works every time You are more likely to get success if you're an experienced investor rather than a new Investor and for a lot of people it pays just to be a long-term investor But for the people that I know that did this they cashed out and weren't planning on buying back in they were buying you know Obviously houses they're buying cars stuff like that like obviously when you make money you want to spend it You're not just gonna keep it in you know an asset forever And but they still have exposure to crypto doesn't like they had cashed out everything And you know I've sold things as well like I didn't sell my eighth But I've sold other things that I invested in over time too Because there's no use kind of like just watching number go up and not taking any profits to actually enjoy the money that you've made And that just you know amplify that across pretty much everyone in this ecosystem And as I said there's never enough kind of like dollars to absorb all of that especially after such a massive move in a short period of time so I Mean that's kind of like what's always going to happen in the crypto ecosystem you have to be wary of that You know you definitely the old saying goes you know be fearful when others are greedy In crypto I mean it's funny because like the greed rears its head like pretty quickly I mean I would actually argue that people were getting real greedy when eighth was at seven hundred dollars But then eighth ended up going to forty four hundred dollars, so if you sold at seven hundred Thinking oh, I'm gonna buy back in because everyone's greedy. It's gonna dump I mean you wouldn't it's not even anywhere close to seven hundred didn't even get close to seven hundred during that massive dump in May of 2021 so Timing these things is basically and they're not impossible, but it's very very hard So that's why you know I'm always a big advocate of being a long-term investor And then over the long term you can take you you know you can take profits at At the point that you want to take them them at kind of thing But trying to trade and time the market and I just I personally not have much success there I know a lot of people that have had way, you know worse experiences than I have they've blown themselves up They've just completely gone out of position because they thought it was going to dump really hard But it ended up like pumping and they bought back higher And then it dumps of course and all that kind of stuff there, but but yeah Just as I said in this tweet keep building You know keep stacking if you've got the ability to do so without you know without kind of like putting in too much money that you can't afford to lose or anything like that and Just get more involved in the ecosystem and the fundamental side There's no point staring at the charts at this at this point in time or just generally there's no point staring at the charts because Like right now. We're just kind of like in this thing where I don't really think there's many humans trading this market It's a lot of bots and bots are just kind of like reading like random signals and things like that not random signals But like pre-programmed signals and it just isn't a very fun kind of like market to be watching right now So yeah Anyway, I'm gonna leave it at that So I just a little bit of I guess like general kind of like overview of how I'm thinking about things right now And and obviously, you know, I think the best thing to do right now is just to get more involved with crypto on the builder side All right. So Burt Miller from flashbots announced a MEV-explore v1 is now live So major updates include users MEV inspect pie, which is I'm assuming like a Python kind of like library Added Uniswap v3 and fixed the bug with some sandwich attacks were classified as arbitrageous Please and he says please note these numbers are lower bound estimates and not reflective of all MEV extracted now Obviously you guys have heard a lot about MEV over the probably last year or so I guess probably more than that at this point and this dashboard. It's not new I've highlighted it before but there's a bunch of updates here. So wanted to highlight again It shows you the lower bound of the MEV that's been extracted over time on the etherium networks You can see here that the cumulative extracted MEV went up massively as obviously the bull market kicked in which was around I guess like May I guess like May 2021 was where prices came off But like mate, so the thing is I guess there was two phases of the of the bull market here There was the the Ethan BTC phase which lasted until about May 2021 Then there was kind of like the quote unquote alt phase and like the L1 phase which lasted until November ish And Ethan BTC went up during that as well But you can see here kind of like the jumps in the MEV and how much MEV is being extracted over time So as I said, this is the lower bound. Apparently there's been at 600 million dollars of total MEV extracted on a theorem over time But you know, that's probably much higher. It could be much higher, right? And on this dashboard it shows you different kind of like MEV classifications if you want to drill down into it a network activity From extracted MEV all this sort of all sort of stuff here. So this is a really cool dashboard Just wanted to put it on your radar. Definitely go check it out for yourself and kind of like dive deep into everything going on here So zk-sync is teasing something at an ethereum block 14 million 256 thousand 320 Which I believe at time of recording it is only another hour or so away So obviously you'll find out maybe before you even watch this But well, I you know my assumption or my kind of like guess about what this is is kind of like zk-sync 2.0 on on test nets or maybe even on main net people were kind of speculating whether this is going to be The token launch I don't think so guys like it doesn't make sense for zk-sync to launch a token at this point in time They still don't have zk-sync 2.0 zk-port or anything like that live yet so a token would just kind of like be pointless at this point in point time and actually distract from just getting these kind of like things out there and and Stuff built out there So curious to see what this is I only brought it up on the reefer because I want to see if I'm right about my prediction here about what it actually is But also I guess like if you haven't seen it yet definitely by the time you've watched this It'll probably be getting announced soon depending when you've watched it and I'm curious to see what it is. So yeah All right So loop ring has has kind of put out a tweet today saying open nft minting is coming to loop ring l2 Anyone can mint nfts on $2 on a theorems faster plus cheaper second layer with the security of a theorem l1 now For the reminder here that loop ring is a zk roll up. It is not an optimistic roll up So it is is kind of like obviously inheriting a theorem security just like an optimistic roll up But but using is a care all up in instead here. They've been making big moves into the nft ecosystem Obviously, there are other kind of like layer twos out there like immutable X but immutable X is not a zk roll up It is a validity. Um, that's why a middle X can offer you free minting because they store data off-chain Whereas loop ring stores data on chain as part of their zk roll up construction But I still think minting nfts for under $2 is pretty damn good at this point in time And that's just gonna get cheaper over time too because as I mentioned yesterday there's a lot of stuff going on on the core protocol side to lower the gas costs of Posting data to l1 and this you know is very beneficial for optimistic roll ups, but also beneficial for zk roll ups as well So we could see zk roll up nft minting potentially under 10 cents sooner rather than later I'm pretty excited about that. But you know, I'm excited for it for the effort to come to a loop ring Anyway, even if it's just under $2 here All right So polygon put out a blog post today discussing a new proof of efficient efficiency protocol that they have come up with for polygon Hermes So this is a new kind of like consensus protocol here that you can kind of like read about this blog post was published yesterday I think I've discussed this before but there wasn't a blog post out about it I think they kind of like put a put a teaser out about it or anything like that But but yeah this blog post gives you an overview of what this is along with polygons zk thesis Of course with a bunch of images So just wanted to put this on your radar to go check out See what's going on here because I think polygons gonna have a big year when it comes to zk stuff I mean all their teams are teasing zk avm test nets this year and I think Hermes is definitely teasing a zk avm on Mainnet this year, which is obviously a big big deal So we'll see how what happens there will see kind of like if that actually happens, but definitely do your reading on zero knowledge stuff I think zero knowledge stuff lay to stuff in general is where you should be spending most of your time right now And learning about it because I mean while the markets are quiet like it's less distractions and you can learn about all this fundamental stuff That's gonna be a very very big deal going forward and not just layer 2 stuff But also call layer 1 protocol things like like dank sharding and stuff like that Definitely gonna be super important going forward and has a lot to do with a layer 2 ecosystem as well All right. So all bit of finance. I brought these guys up a few weeks ago One of the new kind of like bridges on on a theory and they're still in alpha But they now support a bunch of different networks So they support obviously a theorem main net but as well as a zk sync arbitrum polygon and optimism, which is really really cool So you can go to orbiter finance in order to kind of like bridge between these chains and they're saying that more networks will be Supported so I'm assuming they're gonna support all EVM compatible networks whether they be l2 l1 or side chains which is really cool as usual with these bridges guys like be careful with them because Basically, they're they're kind of like very new very kind of like untested. This is in alpha You could lose funds always kind of like due to diligence here And I think the way orbiter works from memory is that it is a kind of like cross chain Exchange rather than just kind of like a like a bridge So basically it's like a hopper connects where you swap assets between different chains So there's probably I mean, I don't know how the orbiter system works under the hood But there's probably less risk there than one of the other bridges, but still always good to kind of like I kind of I guess like take that risk into account and make sure that That you know what you're doing, you know what assets you're bridging You know what's happening under the hood to protect yourself and you know, actually now that I think about it I don't know if they support all these chains right now because they're saying more networks will be supported I think in their buyer they say they only support zk-sync at Albatrom right now So I'm assuming that that either polygon and optimism are coming soon or they're supporting it now I mean I I'd click on this link here, but I don't know what wallet selected in metamask And I don't want that popping up and ruining my privacy So I'm not gonna do that right now, but you can go check it out for yourself. Anyway there Alright last l2 related update so l2 beat for those of you don't know are hosting a layer to our conference in Amsterdam Now they have opened up attendee applications and in this kind of like Google Doc here, which you can go fill out I'll link this in the YouTube description So if you want to attend you definitely need to fill this out it took me like less than 60 seconds to fill it out I'm definitely hoping that I can get a slot there. Not sure how many kind of like tickets are available for this I'm sure that it is going to be a very very oversubscribed event And it is as it is dedicated to if your own slates wicker system and it is going to be as part of the kind Of like dev connect event that's happening in Amsterdam there the one that I'm like so excited about this guy like I can't wait at This point guys like I'm so so excited about it more excited than a kid waiting for Christmas That's for sure, but yeah, I hope to see a lot of you there even if you don't get accepted to this There's so many events happening in Amsterdam around that 8th dev connect I think there's like 10 days worth of events happening so if you want to kind of like get involved and be there you don't Necessarily have to go to this layer to event will get accepted to be there So I'm hoping to see a lot of you there anyway, but if you want to definitely go I guess sign up using this form And hopefully you'll be able to attend the layer 2 conference in Amsterdam So Elizabeth here from the chain safe team Put together a thread on something that she worked at with with a bunch of people over sorry with with one other person Jimmy here At 8th, Denver, so she worked on a privacy project So it's a it's a peer-to-peer method for D linking accounts and transactions that happens entirely off chain So there isn't an explicit on-chain trace of mixing coins transactions The motivation for this was that currently you need to use tornado cache or a similar mixer to mix coins before deploying Interacting with a contract to do link it from your usual account But it's evident that you mixed your coins The solution is similar to an off-chain coin swap that uses some crypto magic called adapter signatures the repos that they built are available here And they plan to continue working on this and eventually have people try it out next steps I'd have fixed all the bucks from the hackathon of course, right? I as you guys know privacy is part of my one of my one of my big kind of like theses for crypto Always happy to highlight this sort of stuff always happy to highlight innovative stuff as well That's that's kind of like trying to do off-chain stuff obviously There is um the there is the phone on network project that he's trying to do off-chain stuff as well a lot of privacy stuff They're happening too, but we need more and more of these tools. I mean I think people really Under estimate how bad it is that we don't have proper privacy on chain it may be okay now because not really many people are Looking at it But in the future like you can imagine They are kind of like being blacklisted for things because a government agency looks at your on-chain history and basically says well These are all your addresses, and we're going to force these exchanges to blacklist you So you can't actually cash out and there are I mean exchanges have blacklisted plenty of addresses in the past Because they've been tied to criminal activity and things like that But I mean as we've seen from the recent drama in drama I guess recent events in Canada The government can just order private companies to do any like to do do their bidding like you know I said this on the ether podcast today but basically who is a bank going to listen to or a centralized exchange going to listen to a Massive government or an individual like whose side are they going to take they're going to take the government side and that you know is What we're trying to build to resist against because we know that's going to happen so we need privacy tools as part of our toolkit there we can't just rely on the The DeFi tools if they're transparent because that is only half the battle the other half I mean, I guess like that's a quarter of the battle. You know this is the scalability There's the privacy aspect and then there's the circular economy aspect which basically means that we need a way to make it so that you Can have a closed loop so that you don't have to rely on centralized exchanges for cashing in and out right at a closed loop Means basically you do everything on crypto rails using decentralized products not using centralized stable coins and centralized debit cards But using like fully decentralized products with privacy preserving technology We're a long way away from that guys like as much as I love a lot of the stuff That's being built for it to be ubiquitous for it to be the standard for it to be cheap and scalable It's still a few years away at least and I would actually argue for it to be actually like be part of like under Default a mainstream it's five to ten years away sort of thing, but we have to build the infrastructure today We have to build the tools today We have to start training users to use this sort of stuff before we can actually move to a point where? It's ubiquitous, and it's mainstream so every little bit helps, and you know every hackathon project helps There's so many hackathon projects that turn into like mega projects on a theorem So if you think that it's just because it happened that a hackathon that a project isn't gonna go far Or it's a small project think again guys like a lot of the time Projects go very very far after after hackathons and some of your your favorite projects that were born out of hackathons as as well there Alright, so we have a pretty big update from status today about They're kind of like app being reborn so they're calling this crypto plus social which is coming in early 2023 So given that this is a big update You know might day. It's taking a while to come out 2023 obviously about a year away early 2023 But in this video they share what's coming so privacy first messaging ad hoc group messaging fully decentralized token gated communities with with a group chat token gated channels token gated privileges And unlike this call they can't shut the communities down a bunch of other integrations you can see on the video here Sorry if I'm stuttering guys I'm just reading off what the video is showing because it's not a threat about this But you know so many features coming that this seems like a complete Reimagination of what the status app is going to is going to be and what it can enable which is really cool because you know The original status vision was to be this they've been building since 2017 they raised a massive ICO back then they have a ton of Money, I mean they always had a token which hasn't really performed very well because it's kind of useless from what I can tell But they've been trying to do web3 decentralized. You know messaging Stuff since 2017 since before it was cool And this you know there's a ton going on like in this preview that they're showing here and the fact that they're saying it's coming In early 2023 means that it's probably early days for this sort of stuff, but I'm super excited about this I mean like if they can actually pull all this off and build all of this And kind of like do it in a way that is actually user-friendly They could blow up really quickly in terms of an app that people use is like their default like I imagine having an app for Basically everything you want to do right crypto wallet private messaging being part of communities through token gating doing Obviously NFT stuff doing DeFi stuff privacy first all these sorts of stuff right and they're saying multi chain wallet, too I mean imagine all of that or any kind of like one app That's a big undertaking and that's why it's gonna take a little while for it for it to get to be released But I feel like that's it's gonna be really cool once it once it happens now you can download the status app right now There are a bunch of features already live on it But obviously a lot of the pages that they're teasing here or pretty much all of them that they're teasing here Aren't available right now, but I'm super excited about it. Just like I'm super excited about all of the web3 stuff That's happened all most of the web3 stuff that it's happening not all of it You know some of it's kind of like just just whack to be honest like I Read a tweet today that someone was saying that The Dow infrastructure space is in a massive bubble right now because it just seems to be hundreds of projects trying to build Dow Infrastructure when in reality we only need maybe a few right now Maybe less than 10 the 5 5 10 kind of like down for structure projects Maybe not even that depends on what the infrastructure is, but that's kind of like how it works right 90% Plus of companies fail and these crypto apps and services their companies at the end of the day 90% of them will fail They're not immune to that. That's just what happens, but the 10% or even maybe less than that Maybe five to ten percent that succeed can go on to become massive billion-dollar companies And we see that play out in the traditional startup world and in the trad fi in in tech and we set out play out With crypto as well And that's what I think actually catches a lot of people off guard is that they end up buying these tokens because the tokens are Liquid like really early on and they think that just because this project has a token has like a really ambitious roadmap and has all these cool things coming that it's like a hundred percent guaranteed to succeed and they go like all in on this Token and the token does nothing because one I mean a lot of the tokens have no actual valuable cruel to the chance of a startup succeeding is extremely low and Three a lot of these tokens are given out for free as part of the quitting money programs It just puts more pressure on the token And kind of like more cell pressure on it So I think when you when you kind of like take all that together You can see why things are so volatile while bull markets catch people off guard And and and why people need to be very careful about what they kind of throw their money into like as I said status has A token called SNT came out in 2017. They raised. I think 150 million dollars in an ICO the token I don't know how much is down by right now. I mean I can probably look it up right now It's down by a lot at this point I would have to say like I don't remember anyone talking about it's down 92 percent from its all-time high It's all-time high was four years ago like over four years ago I think at this point in time it had a little bit of a pump into May 2021 But still and that's down 92 percent against USD. I don't even know what it's down against It's probably a lot more than that so the product is is sound they're building They're still building They're building a lot of different things and status also has a team Called Nimbus that they built like a client an e2 client around to obviously doing a lot of good work for the ecosystem But none of that has translated to the token because the token literally has no value accrual mechanism. It's pretty much useless so just a note there for you guys a Prime example of what happens when you kind of like want to bet on a team and bet on what they're building and you bet On their token which is not the right way to bet on it, and it kind of like I goes to shit like that But anyway, I'm gonna leave it at that for today, so thank you everyone for listening and watching Be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give the video a thumbs up subscribe to newsletter join the disco channel And I'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone. You

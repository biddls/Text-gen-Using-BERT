 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the dailygue refuel where I kept the latest news in the theorem ecosystem I'm your host Anthony sasano and today's 28th of July 2022. Alright everyone. Let's get into it So we have the official girlie slash Prada merge announcement today So Prada which is the I guess capoeira stake chain that girlie is going to be merging with Will run through the ballotrix upgrade on August 4th and merge with girly between August 6th and August 12th It's a wide window there But basically obviously it's based on TDD if you want to know to a validator This is your last chance to go through the process before main net so as you guys know girly will be the last public test Net to go through the merge transition before we do it on main net you can read this kind of announcement post for both full details here Along with client releases for both the consensus and execution layers with an FAQ as well To remind you of basically what you will need to do for the contest And what you also be needing to do on main net as well as I mentioned before that there is that merge readiness Checklist make sure that you're familiar with that make sure that if you're a solo staker you are Upgrading your kind of like nodes and your validators and you're and you're kind of like doing the other things on that list such as optionally Running me V boost if you want to take advantage of that, but also doing things Doing the other things on that list as well and there's a reminder in this kind of blog post that you can check out too But you can go check that out And yeah as I mentioned the clients are out there too, so the geth kind of like releases here as well So this configures the merge ttd on the girly test net and fixes a few regressions So very cool to see the if I guess quote unquote official announcement. We already knew it was coming at this date But yeah, it's kind of like being be confirmed here as I said last public test net to run through the transition I mean I feel like at this point. We're just running through the motions guys I gets I think girly is just the formality at This point I think we're pretty much ready to merge main net We just got to go through girly and then obviously get the september and do the main net merge Hopefully in the week of September 19th I don't see any reason for it to be pushed back at this point in time like honestly I mean I've got a kind of like an update here about the shadow fork 10 which is main net shadow fork 10 Everything seemed to go very very well you can see here this update comes from Parathosh where he said they didn't notice any client Incompatibilities with the transition which was awesome I mean we sometimes see this right with these kind of like shadow forks or a lot of the time see this Well, we didn't see it on main net shadow fork 10 Some base who knows we're running the older version and even an update Resync that it explained almost all the missing participation rate the node should be done Raking soon the participation rate should go back up We noticed load star Aragon pair having trouble fetching a block But this is most likely attributed to the shadow fork peering setup rather rather than a real issue so again bunch of non merge related Issues, I guess like only a couple there, which is amazing I mean the fact that There's no client in compatibilities with the transition at all between all of the kind of Production ready clients on the execution and consensus layer side is awesome I think I don't know the date for main net shadow fork 11 yet, but I'm sure it's going to be coming soon But I mean at this point. It's just kind of like we know what to do We've done it so many times it works Well, we know what can go wrong how to recover from things that go wrong like a dropping participation rate due to configuration issues We know how quickly that we can recover from them on test nets But we're going to be quicker on main net because there's real value at stake no pun intended or pun intended And then yeah, I think that it's all pretty much kind of like test it out at this point as I said formalities from now I don't think the testing that we're doing now is really anything then kind of like I Guess like triple checking could you pull checking quintuple checking our work? Essentially and girly will be that final public test net and then we'll move on to the main net so very very cool to to see that All right So I saw a bit of discussion today on Twitter around something related to the merge And I basically put a tweet out where I said you know I'm seeing influences and miners shilling a possible aetherium a proof-of-work Fork today now people are free to fork a theorem at the time of the merge and continue it as a proof-of-work chain But basically everything on that chain will break especially defi, but hey I won't say no to dumping proof-of-work eith for more eith now the reason why people were talking about this is because I come I Can't remember his name. I think his name is Chandler grew or He's basically a big minor was responsible for or a big part of the ethereum classic fork Announced today on Twitter that they're planning to do a kind of like power only fork of aetherium You know once the merge happens I've talked about this on the refill before I've talked about it for a long time actually and I mentioned that I believe there was A high chance this would happen because there's money to be made right look you might think to yourself Well who's going to be buying the forks kind of like eith tokens here? Who's going to be buying the proof-of-work fork eith tokens look guys? I don't know how long you've been around for but these markets can be really dumb and Not just dumb if there is enough people kind of buying into this narrative buying into the trade Then you're going to have the speculators you're going to have the everyday traders jumping into this as well which is adds more liquidity adds more kind of like buy pressure and Yeah, this thing could Obtain some kind of value right, but the thing is is that this isn't like a bitcoin And bitcoin cash fork from 2017 that was definitely an ideology thing This is more of a kind of like let's see if we can get free money thing and also Bitcoin is very very different to aetherium in kind of like forking when bitcoin cash forked off You know you instead of BTC on bitcoin cash you have BCH and that was really it there was nothing else that needed to be kind of like worried about but when you fork ethereum You have to worry about basically everything else on the chain now Let me use a clear example here for DeFi the clearest example I can use to illustrate my point is stable coins right within kind of like DeFi even just stable coins in general if you Have the ethereum proof-of-stake chain, which is the canonical chain? It's the one that we're all using it's one that everyone agrees is the real ethereum And then you have this proof-of-work chain that has basically everything ethereum had before it merged to prove a stake Well the stable coins on that proof-of-work chain Logically are going to go to zero like especially the centralized ones because circle and coinbase the issuer of USDC I'm not going to honor the USDC tokens on the proof-of-work ethereum chain They're going to honor them on the proof-of-stake ethereum chain so say there's 50 billion dollars of USDC in circulation There's only 50 billion dollars in cash backing that up. There's not a hundred billion So they can't basically cover there I guess like IOU so to speak on the proof-of-work ethereum chain Which means that USDC on that chain should logically trade at zero because it's it's it's worthless right same goes for tether Same goes for any centralized stable coin the decentralized stable coins get a bit murky I mean if you talk about something like DAI the ETH backing the DAI would be worth would be the proof-of-work eith Right would be worth a lot less than real eith will be worth Whatever the speculators are kind of like making it worth at the time same goes for all the tokens out there So it's not like when the fork happens you're going to be able to get I guess like all this free money You're going to get like double your money. No that's not how it works at all you might get like a Fraction of what you get for your real tokens right for example. Maybe you get 10% of the value I mean, I don't even think you'll get that to be honest like maybe Depending on how much hype there is around this depending how much speculation is around it this It's just it's impossible to tell but the paperwork ethereum chain everything's going to break on there There's going to be no oracles are supporting it either because the oracles are kind of like set up to support The if you're improving stake chain post merge right because that is the canonical chain There's going to be a lot of people kind of like selling into these liquidity pools and trying to get out There's going to be a shit ton of MeV happening as well on the chain like honestly It's going to be like you know that the whole thing is going to blow up But there's going to be so many people probably trying to get out right and get the money out and try and make money and Try and dump all their tokens as fast as possible that the MeV stuff is going to be incredibly lucrative And it's going to you know jump a lot of attention is going to be a lot of speculation around me So I do want to give fair warning here is that there as I said before there is a high chance of this happening But it doesn't mean that this chain is worth anything or is legit It just means that the speculator is trying to make money or what they perceive to be free money It's kind of like how ethereum classic has gone to be value of the last few weeks Because there's some narrative around it that all the miners are going to move to a theorem classic And then people are going to use a theorem classic or what like some bizarre things that I'm seeing it's like okay well No That's just people pushing this narrative because they want to trade it leading up to kind of like the merge And they want to make money and you know so far It's it's worked I guess people who are trading this but Traders investors as I've discussed before very very different timelines very very different sets of people and also I want to say when if this fork was to happen It's it's similar to kind of like the theorem classic fork It's not like you're going to get airdrop to the proof-of-work eth tokens on your main ethereum wallet on proof of stake ethereum That's not how it works at all the proof-of-work chain is a completely separate chain It has nothing to do with the ethereum chain That's going to be proof of stake right the canonical chain So you would have to as you do with basically layer twos and other net other EVM networks You would have to change your network in meta mask and you would want to make sure that you're on the right network as well You want to make sure that you can actually push transactions through that's another thing as well like if in Fuhrer Or alchemy or any of these service providers don't have a way for you to push Transactions through because they don't have the node set up for it Then you're gonna probably have to run your own local node to do that and As I said the MEV people are going to take full advantage of this because they know exactly what they're doing It's gonna be quite wild to watch play out But essentially if you want to access access those forked coins You would have to change the network and then your balances would change to what you have on I guess like the ethereum power fork and obviously the dollar value of those coins would be worth a lot less than it would be For the real coins on on ethereum. So yeah, it's gonna be messy if it does happen as I said I think there's a high chance that it happens just because it's made to be made here for the people that want to make it Happen but it's going to be completely worthless and and kind of like a relevant chain It's not going to basically have any activity on it. I doubt any developers or applications are really going to Embrace it especially the major ones and it's going to hurt a lot of people because people are not gonna understand what they're doing The MEV people are going to understand what they're doing They're going to extract so much value The people that are that kind of like know that that basically everything on that chains going to zero are gonna get out first Right, even if it pumps up a little bit like this is something I think a lot of people miss Is that say the kind of like fork happens and then the ETH on the proof of work chain is worth $10 I'm just throwing out a random kind of figure there and then you sell it all at 10 bucks and then it goes to 20 bucks Because of some speculation like that doesn't mean anything like ETC did the same thing After the fork and that was actually a completely different fork mind you it was based on an ideological thing kind of like the Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash fork But just because it's gone up in value doesn't mean it's gonna stay there like once the speculation and hype phase is over It's gonna just trend to zero like look at Bitcoin cash against Bitcoin like not against USD But again, I mean even against USD it's pretty wrecked But against Bitcoin is just like obliterated same with all the other fork like Bitcoin SV Bitcoin gold Bitcoin diamond there were all just I mean, I think Bitcoin gold and diamond are basically scams But basically they're all just kind of like sold off to get the real tokens because no one cares about these things They want to stack BTC. They would want to stack ETH, right? So if this if this happens, I'm 100% like I'm gonna be completely transparent here I'm selling everything that I get The day that I get it and for more ETH like as I said I'm not going to say no to free ETH just because some people wanted to make more money here and at the end of the Day, people are buying this and speculating on it. That's not my fault Like I as I've said before I'm giving warnings and tell people that the chain is gonna blow up like this is not going to Be a good thing for anyone. Um But the thing is if I can stack more ETH with it then so be it I mean, I'm sure a lot of you guys would take advantage of this as well but as I said I do want to warn that it is not just a clear-cut thing like you're going to Have to kind of like consider the fact that you you basically have to have some way to relay your transactions Whether that be through a third party or your own node and you'll also have to consider the MEV Consequences the fact that everything's gonna blow up, you know all that sort of stuff in saying that as well I do want to note that it's not gonna affect anything on the main Ethereum chain on the you know, the canonical chain That's all gonna be well and good all the value of your tokens will be what they are I mean, they'll be obviously based on the market price But that's the real kind of like tokens right and DeFi will continue to work fine So I that's kind of like a note there because I know some people won't be thinking. Oh my god You know what's gonna happen to my stuff if there is a fork and it's contentious and all these sorts of stuff Well, I mean nothing really and also on top of that because they're two different consensus mechanisms, right? Once we have work once we were a stake there's no hash wars I remember when in the Bitcoin Bitcoin cash war There was a hash war where miners would just keep changing between the two chains that can't happen with it with this because obviously they're Two completely different things, right? So that's another thing to bear in mind So nothing to stress about maybe you'll make some free money. Maybe you won't if this happens but do keep in mind that it's not just a clear-cut thing there are consequences for these sorts of things and And kind of like depending on what you do on the fork chain, right? If you're going to speculate if you're actually gonna buy like selling is fine But if you're actually going to buy these things just be kind of like just completely understand the fact that it's pure speculation You're not actually buying anything based on fundamentals. You're buying it all based on speculation and you're allowed to do that Don't get me wrong like feel free to do that But I think I just want to kind of put that warning out there that it it may not end Well, right, there's no guarantee you're gonna make money from that. But yeah, anyway, leave it at that for today Let's go on to the next update So the key I saw this interesting tweet from Keon who's the co-founder of Monad here Where he said a lot a lots of EVM FUD on the timeline lately and there has been right like Everyone loves to hate on the EVM loves to hate on solidity all that sorts of stuff But then Keon kind of continues and say it says EVM is a powerful bytecode standard that has stood the test of time will continue to evolve with new up codes and feats has Malt multiple great high leverage languages such as solidity and viper and will get much more performance and they're working on that at Mona So if you don't know what Mona it is is basically a kind of a team that's accelerating the EVM ecosystem for world adoption That's what they're saying here. I'm gonna follow that account now. But yeah guys like I've talked about the EVM dominance before I mean, I think I talked about it recently So I'm not gonna get to kind of like into the weeds here But like I think we really need to encourage people to or not encourage But like make people aware the fact that the EVM is going nowhere solidity is going nowhere. It's going to keep growing It's going to keep dominating even the people and the ecosystem that say that the EVM is shit and solidity shit They have their own EVM chains I mean It's just hilarious whenever I see that because the EVM such a has such a large network effect that actually makes sense for them to Do that so it's easy for apps to port over and all that sorts of stuff So yeah, whenever you see EVM FUD or anything like that, just know that it's actually FUD and yeah, okay The EVM isn't perfect But it can be improved over time and it has such a large Network effect that it's worth improving it like it's very worth improving it And as I said before we on layer 2 we're gonna have the EVM compatible and equivalent stuff But we're also going to have other ecosystems like Stark net that aren't EVM at all And there's gonna be other layer twos that also aren't EVM and they have their own virtual machine their own languages and that's fine But I guess you can have that and not fight the EVM at the same time, right? So yeah, I just want to mention that I think there's a couple more tweets here and some discussion in the thread I'll link it in the description below for you to check out All right. So speaking of I guess like languages there is this new language that was released today called huff Which is I guess claiming to be the most gas optimized smart contract language to ever touch the EVM Huff enables you to optimize your contracts by up to 80% compared to other languages like solidity and viper Very cool for the developers out there Like as I said guys the EVM just gonna keep getting better and better now We have another new language for this based on kind of like gas optimizations You may think yourself or why do we need gas optimizations if we're moving to layer twos? It's the same thing right layer twos even compatible equivalent layer twos Still use the concept of gas so anything we can do to reduce those costs there at the smart contract language level We're just going to just reduce the overall cost of those layer two transactions and get them like really really really cheap So very very cool to see I think this is made by the someone at Aztec Protocol one of the co-founders of Aztec protocol, which is really cool to see But yeah If you're a developer and you want to learn more about this and kind of like how you can get involved in I can start using It you can get a huff dot SH But yeah, I mean I guess like for non developers out there It's probably not interesting to you, but I thought it was worth mentioning in the context of the EVM stuff that I just talked about Alright, so this came out yesterday and I didn't see it until after I recorded yesterday's refuel But basically another update here from rocket pool on their redstone. I guess like protocol upgrade that is coming So this update is called the merge and node operators And basically what it does is it goes through how things are changing for I guess rocket pool node operators here So you can read the full blog post for what's changing on rocket pool side There's actually a lot of changes and I think I've gone through this before There's naming changes changes with the engine API which is actually on the ethereum protocol side fee recipient So that's again on the ethereum protocol side But you're gonna need to set your fee recipients if you're a solar validator or if you're kind of like a rocker pool validator I know operator here and me V boost as I mentioned before it's an optional extra But definitely something you want to take advantage of and then there are other sections, you know How do I prepare for the merge and kind of some things that are rocker pool related as well here? So if you fall into that camp, definitely kind of check out this blog post for the details I like this little graphic that I have here basically showing us kind of like where we Where we kind of like moving to with the merge and kind of like how it relates to rocker pool down the bottom here So yeah, I mean this is kind of like similar I guess little graphic I guess I compared to what Trent Van Epps has put out prior I think I've showed that on the refill before many times actually and it's kind of like a little timeline here as well Which is very very cool. So yeah, just more merge related stuff this time what to do with rocker pool Which you guys know I love and also speaking of rocker pool is another update here that a thousand eighth was deposited today in In rocker pool, which is very cool to see and I didn't even know this website existed But there's a website called rocket scan dot IO which I guess is the rocker pool kind of Explorer here This is really cool. I didn't I as I said, I didn't know this existed I don't know how I hadn't seen this before but it has all Kinds of metrics and stats and kind of like different kind of things you can keep keep track of here Which I think is very very cool and on this page It basically shows the deposit pool and you can kind of see the kind of like 1000 eight that was deposited here into the rocker pool protocol I think this is gonna keep going guys like I mean Rockerpool is making those big kind of upgrades that I've talked about before they're lowering the barrier to entry for people I think more and more people learning about it through the bankless kind of like ads that they're doing obviously I talk about it On the refill a lot too But yeah I'm loving the fact that rocker pool just getting more and more usage here and I was actually looking at um Lido's dominance just before on hill dobby's hill dobby's here doing analytics dashboard I'll bring it up over here for you guys so you can see what I mean, but Lido's market share Was what? 33.5 almost 34 percent or something like that and as I said before its market share can't actually go down From kind of like with people withdrawing out of Lido because the eighth is still staked on the beacon chain because there's not withdrawals Available but their market share can go down if other validators or if other kind of like services Come online to dilute their market share. So Lido's market share is down to 31.4 percent now So it's dropped by about two to two point five percent Which is which is cool to see obviously a slower drop because as I said people can't withdraw out of Lido directly But like we want to get this down as much as possible rocker pools obviously working on it There's a bunch. Yeah, so many people doing staking these days I mean not just kind of like these LSDs or liquid staking derivatives But also the exchanges and other services and things like that as well. So that's cool But yeah I don't know I'm kind of I always get into this debate with people about kind of like what this number is gonna look like this I guess Like steak through Lido number is gonna look like once withdrawals are enabled and I do firmly believe That people are going to reshuffle their steak I know I've said it and I'm gonna probably keep saying it until withdrawals are enabled But you know as I said, there's only two ways for the market share to go down And they could probably have a double whammy where the market share gets withdrawn from Lido But at the same time a lot of people are staking their Ethan. They're not going through Lido They're going through another provider such as rocker pool, which would be very cool Obviously, I don't want rocker pool to just replace lighter and then we just kind of got the you know Hey, it's the new boss. Same as the old boss sort of thing going on I do want a very distributed kind of like beacon chain and a very decentralized beacon chain You can see here what the kind of like breakdown looks like right now Lido number one I kind of like coinbase Kraken finance have a large share here. Not as big as as kind of like As I thought actually which is which is cool to see you have an others kind of I guess a category here and a bunch Of other categories as well So if we could just keep shrinking each of these down like enough because right now I mean, you know You kind of like put Lido Binance Kraken and coinbase together. It's a pretty hefty kind of like share of the network I mean that alone is over 50% right? So if you kind of like put them together not great, but Lido isn't just lighter It's obviously distributed among kind of different staking providers and they have like 28 different staking providers now So there's that aspect to it as well But getting each of these down to maybe like I don't know I want to say we don't want any one entity to have over 10% of kind of like the stake right it And I don't think that's actually too hard to achieve like it may seem like it's it's difficult to achieve right now We have two entities over 10% coinbase at 14.6% Lido at 31.3% But post withdrawals being enabled and more and more competition coming online more and more staking service providers coming online I think we can get there. I really do I know people have a different view on this thinking that Especially people who are bullish on lighter they have this thesis that it's all just gonna centralize within Lido Because of liquidity effects and all that sort of stuff and I actually understand that point of view don't get me wrong But I really don't think that it's going to end up like that I think that people who think in that kind of like absolute term I kind of like a bit short-sighted I do think that the Ethereum community cares enough about kind of like keeping the beacon that chain stake decentralized and distributed and I also Believe that the competition is going to get so fierce that there are going to be different incentives on you know For different kind of like providers and once withdrawals are enabled people can kind of like stake restake do all these sorts of things I know there's a queue right? It's not like you can just cop in and out all the time There is definitely a queue to to stake and unstake But I don't think that Lido is going to stay at 31.3% dominance, right? I really don't think so I mean I think it could be a below 30% easily by the time we get too big in chain withdrawals being enabled because you know other Providers have just gotten more stake within them, but we'll have to see how that shakes out But yeah, as I said, I don't think this is something of Kind of like long-term concern But I'm really really happy that people are still shouting it out and still kind of like making noise about it because at least keeps The awareness up keeps it on top of people's minds just like we did with client diversity I think the client diversity drive proves that we can we have the muscle to do this and we have the kind of like ability To do this obviously It's not apples to apples because of the fact that I'm client diversity and you know Who you stake with is probably two different things, but it just shows that the social layer can enact You know grand change when it wants to and I was looking at this the other day and I posted this in the discord channel the other day about Coinbase and Kraken they were using I think over 90% prism at one point now They're at like 45% or something like that's that's half like and prism being the majority client What was the majority client the supermajority client? I should say on the big in chain and that changed within a few months So it really does show the power of the social layer, which I think can definitely be applied to staking And I hope that the people that have been kind of like shouting from the rooftops about liquid staking derivative centralization Especially around lido continue to do so even if I disagreed with some of the tactics like making lido self-limit I I still disagreed with that tactic. It's obviously not going to happen But that's fine I think even making noise about it in that context was still good because it made people more aware of the issue and It probably got people to rethink if they were going to stake with lido or they're going to stay with a minority provider or something Like that, so I as I said, I still think it's important I still think it's something worth talking about so kudos to those people that talked about that All right, so the snapshot for the gho proposal which is the kind of like obvious stablecoin here is now public You can go check this out on snapshot link will be in the youtube description below I think this is going to pass don't foresee people voting against this it seems like a good idea I don't know if we need another stablecoin, but we'll see I mean Maybe we do need another decentralized stablecoin to compete because we just kind of like don't have many of those these days So yeah, if you're kind of like an avid token holder you can definitely go vote in this but even if you're not you can kind of like just keep tabs on these keep kind of like Keep a kind of like pulse on what's happening in the other community with regards to this I'm definitely keeping a close eye on it. I think then the ticker should definitely be changed gho Just it doesn't look good as a ticker especially with something like a stablecoin Which is obviously going to be used more than a regular token. I think that should change the ticker Maybe they will before it goes live, but that's the only feedback. I really have on it I'm just curious to see how this kind of like kind of another decentralized stablecoin experiment is going to play out So I'm definitely excited for that, but yeah, just wanted to mention that the snapshot is now live But I do think that this is going to go through with no kind of no drama here All right, so Jacob horn here from Zorro put out this I guess like really important Image that I really really liked where on it's kind of like a spectrum here on the left side of the spectrum You've got the top kind of label being protocol and then under that saying forkable and then on the right side of the spectrum You have brand and then unforkable and I think this is a very simple way of showing that Taking for an example of theorem and the EVM very easy to fork it right everyone's done it You know people have made money off it. There are so many chains out there that have done at this point It's it's it's it's easily done because it's all open source and it's kind of like it's kind of like a An everyday thing that people do at this stage and then you have brand which is unforkable just because you fork Ethereum and the EVM doesn't mean you fork the ethereum brand like all you have is the technology You don't have the brand you don't become a theorem just because you forked it right and this goes back to my Earlier discussions in the episode about kind of like the proof of work fork right you don't get any of the legitimacy That ethereum has you don't get any of the social gym you actually probably get negative legitimacy because people view your chain and like And kind of like okay. Well you're just a fork of a theory We just a fork of geth it's kind of like worthless We have too many of these you know who cares about that right you don't get any of the I mean Maybe you get some of the community maybe but like most of them don't come over Maybe you get some liquidity during like a bull market because people want to make money But really at the end of the day like the brand the ethereum brand does not come with you You're just forking the technology and even if you have like the EVM which is obviously stands for the ethereum virtual machine It doesn't matter because your EVM is not the EVM like for example And it doesn't just go for a theorem it goes for everything else in in crypto Especially Uniswap how many times has Uniswap been forked the protocol. I should say sorry the brand definitely not I mean the funny thing is like we had this massive war between sujashop and Uniswap Sujashop is basically irrelevant these days Uniswap is dominating like absolutely dominating Then you had pancakes up on BSC and then you had a bunch of others on other kind of like chains It just forked Uniswap all of them are very very small compared to Uniswap Because Uniswap has that incredible brand that incredible kind of like awareness around that brand and And kind of like all the goodwill kind of like all the social legitimacy and all the technical legitimacy as well right like if you fork The code there are changes you can make to it as well so even if you fork Kind of like Uniswap, and you don't change anything There's no kind of like I guess like a guarantee that you won't change it in the future Maybe you added an admin key to it and everything else stay the same well now. It's kind of like okay well You might change it. You're not Uniswap at all. You're something completely different now right I guess like you're not Uniswap the protocol Obviously not the brand It goes for everything I mean I can give a million examples here But I think you get the point and I think this is something that especially kind of like newcomers to crypto completely miss Is that they think that because everything is open source you can just like you know you can just like you know you can just Kind of like fork something and take its value away You know I mean maybe temporarily There might be some kind of like war that goes on between a couple of protocols like the Uniswap, SushiSwap thing But long term you don't take any value away from the original the original stays dominant unless it's like unless the original is Kind of like crappy already or unless the original kind of like failed already, and you think you can do something better There's not that many examples of these obviously there's been a lot of forks, but the original always seems to win out I think maybe an example of this might be steam what happened to steam where Justin Sun took it over And then they kind of like forked off into hive I think hive got all of the steam users and has much more legitimacy But in terms of like forks overall It's usually the original that retains its value and retains its social legitimacy because of that brand right not because of the technology And you know the brand kind of like carries a technology So I just thought that was a great graphic, and I just wanted to kind of like give my view on it there I Finally here. I just wanted to highlight this kind of tweet from David Hoffman So this is a list of all of the ETC interviews that he did and this is a pretty stellar list if I if I may Say so myself so the first episode I think is out already which is the Vitalik episode But then he has a bunch of different guests on his came from synthetics as Uri and Eli from Starkware Halo from Polygon, I think this is sunny from from osmosis the cosmos ecosystem I has Tani from our there proven authority which I believe is Evan from disco and a walkie and Austin here I'll walk you from get coin and Austin Griffith from a bunch of different kind of like things with the new theory community He's definitely one of our top builders, but yeah, I mean I can't wait to listen to all of these I haven't listened to the Vitalik one yet apparently it's really good, so I'm definitely listen to that soon But yeah just to kill one up here obviously all on bankless wanted to highlight it for you guys So you don't miss it, but on that note. I think that's going to be it for today So thank everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give it a thumbs up subscribe to Newsletter join the disco channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow.

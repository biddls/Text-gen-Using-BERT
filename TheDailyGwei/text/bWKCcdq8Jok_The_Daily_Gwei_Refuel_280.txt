 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the dailygue refuel worry cap the latest news near theorem ecosystem I'm your host Anthony sasana and today's the 27th of December 2021. All right, everyone. Let's get into it So hope you all had a great Christmas over the weekend on Friday. I Realized like pretty late that it was Christmas Eve and I'm like, oh god, I'm busy right now I don't think I'm gonna have time to do the refuel So I didn't announcement in the discord channel saying that I do a refuel on Monday and take a kind of like break on Friday, so yeah, I'm back here not much has happened actually over the last few days It obviously being kind of like Christmas time end of year things slowed down considerably So not much has happened on the kind of like projects update front or anything like that So got a few things to get through today, but not that much I will keep doing the refill all the way through I think New Year's actually what what what what? New Year's Eve is on a Friday as well. So I may not do I think it's this Friday So I may not do it this Friday Um pro and then newsdays are Saturday. So I probably won't do a refill this Friday But as I said, there's not much happening right now The markets seem to be quiet to like NFT seem to be catching a bit again I've noticed all over the last 24 hours, which is funny to see but I think Pretty much January is gonna be packed I think a lot of projects right now are waiting until January to announce certain things whether they announce You know come out of stealth with an ounce major upgrade updates or anything like that because right now it really is the skeleton crew online I've noticed the Twitter kind of people on Twitter are just um Definitely kind of a lot less and I also noticed the biggest thing to happen was the SOS airdrop Whatever that kind of like was there didn't look too much into it I just saw it and I kind of like claimed mine and sold it because I'm like, oh well some some more eighth Um, but but yeah Anyway, let's get into the updates from the last three days One thing that I wanted to talk about was this thing from Yi Zhang who is a co-founder And works in research at scroll now scroll is one of the zk teams that I've been speaking out about for quite a while now And he shared on Twitter basically a research post from the team a consensus working on zk stuff Basically specifying the zk EVM now you'll have listened to me talk about the zk VM quite a lot on on the refuel and about how multiple teams are attempting this it's basically attempting to create a generalized ZK Sorry generalized EVM platform built on zk technology So obviously we have that with optimistic roll-ups right now with arbitrary and optimism and a few others out there But we don't have it for zk yet We have generalized zk stuff like what starkway is building with stark net but that is not EVM compatible or even equivalent or anything like that is that is using their own language and you know their own kind of Technology there. Whereas the Holy Grail that people are working towards right now A lot of people believe out the Holy Grail is is this zk EVM thing now polygon is working on this things Zk sync is working on this. I'm sure stark has been looking into this scroll is definitely working on it and consensus here has put together a spec basically basically kind of trying to define what a zk VM looks like so that everyone's working off the same thing because you can have Different implementations of it, you know polygon could have their own zk VM and zk sync could have their own and scroll could have their own but it kind of just creates a complexities It's kind of like okay Well if we want a zk VM why not just all of us build something to the to a spec, right? Why not build something similar when I build it so that we can all kind of like know what's going on with it instead Of reinventing the wheel so to speak so that's exactly what's being done here with this PDF that you can read by the consensus teams I just downloaded here and kind of open it. So this is a specification for Zk, a VM done by the consensus applied R&D team and you can see the names of the people that did this up here It's a 41 page kind of specification. It is very very technical I mean don't bother reading it if you don't know, you know, don't know the technicals of not only zk tech But also the EVM and just general kind of blockchain Low level blockchain stuff. I definitely didn't read this myself because I knew exactly what it was I mean you can see all the equations and everything in here This is not for the at the average kind of like a person to give it a read But as I just described to you what it was basically the abstract is and I can basically read out the abstract here to get I kind of like full breakdown. This is basically in plain English what this what this paper is So in in kind of specification the the consensus applied R&D team describes a zk EVM Arithmeticization supporting the three following design goals support for all EVM op codes including internal smart contract codes error management and gas management ability to execute bytecode as is and minimal prover time we strive to provide an error Erythematization that respects the EVM specification as defined the Ethereum yellow paper We provide an original and comprehensive approach of the zk EVM problem Which is technically realizable using existing zero knowledge proving system proving schemes. So This is pretty exciting right because if I mean if this does work practically obviously, it's just a paper right now but if it does work practically it means that we basically have the If your em as it exists today the EVM as it exists today in a zk form now, obviously zk tech is He's amazing, but still very early days and that's why people are working on this sort of stuff. You can see here Vitalik basically Commented saying this is amazing work. Are there any draft implementations? Because there's the paper then there's the implementations. We obviously want to see the implementations. I don't know if there's any implementations yet I think it's just the paper But I'm sure we're gonna see more and more of this stuff come out over the coming months from the various zk teams because as I said, this is the Holy Grail once we crack this once we get Kind of like a generalized Evm using zk tech it becomes something that a lot of people are going to use very quickly It's going to I think it's going to get adoption very quickly Um, and and I think the reason why things like I mean Stark nets had some pretty decent adoption Same with Stark X and things like that But imagine if Stark where zk tech was built using the EVM right like how many projects would have already deployed there So and they've just got a different approach there, which I actually think is healthy because we don't you know I mean the AVM isn't perfect even is basically I guess like you could say solidity is basically the JavaScript of the crypto worlds of the web3 world it is going to be around forever It's probably going to be dominant forever, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be attempting to make other kind of Virtual machines adopt other languages and that's exactly what stock is doing zk sync is also trying to do it with their llvm Polygon has a bunch of different kind of efforts going on there, but really do it getting a zk Evm to work in production is a huge deal So yeah go get this specification a read if you're interested in that sort of stuff as I said very very heavy on the technical Low-level core kind of like Debbie stuff. Um, so yeah, just just a fair warning there So 0x mons Basically for a little bit of a Christmas present put out a video here where they decided to vampire attack open sea Infrastructure with pseudo swap so any open sea link for an nft now redirects to pseudo swap if you change the P to a W Making it all in C one click to make swap offers and and asset pages let you see what offers have been made now pseudo swap is Being built on I think zk sync last time I checked or at least it was experimenting with zk sync but You know the funny thing is with these kind of like vampire attacks on open sea or at least kind of like these competitors to open Seas that they couldn't be coming soon enough. I think open sea has enjoyed way too much of a I guess like a Cruisy adoption cycle where there hasn't really been any competition for them. They need competition They they're not bad, but they could be so much better than what they are And I think I mentioned it on the refuel maybe maybe a couple weeks ago or something how they actually planning to do an IPO And not issue a token I'm not sure if they're gonna change their true in there because a lot of people are upset that they're not doing a token But if they did choose to do an IPO instead of a token, I mean that really does up Does kind of like open the floodgates to a bunch of vampire attacks to come in and basically say well We're like open C But we have a token and get the community on board now whether it work is another kind of thing Because vampire attacking can be pretty lucrative in the short term if you have a token if you have a good narrative behind it but there's a lot more to running a product like Open-see than just slapping a token on it and forking the infrastructure and the code and obviously 0x mons knows this I'm not saying that they have done this thinking that Oh and C is going to you know completely destroy open C overnight or anything like that. They are building a Kind of NFT ecosystem with pseudo swap and and stuff like that, but essentially yeah I mean, I think people get this false sense of security where they're basically like, okay We can just easily fork this code We can fork this infrastructure and we can just run this thing with a token and we're gonna be the best and we're gonna take Over the world. That's just not how it works There's so much more that goes into building a successful product and service I mean not only is it really hard to break the incumbents network effect, even if you do a vampire attack With liquidity or whatever you some liquidity mining or whatever you want to want to call and do some a drops or whatever You also have to have the experience you have to have the team there You have to be able to out compete the purse the young the ecosystem that your vampire attacking like for example The you know, the classic example of a vampire attack is sushi swap on on uni swap now So just what isn't a failure, but it is nowhere near as big as uni So brightly uniswap is still miles bigger and that's because uni swap wasn't just this thing that sat around and stopped innovating They kept innovating they count with v3, which has been a huge success You know, they also did their token I think partly in response to to sushi swap and they at least they did it sooner than they probably would have liked Which got a bunch of people back as well because they did the the awesome airdrop and things like that but the sushi swap kind of experiment seemed to I got into a lot of trouble over time because it was very chaotic It was that you know that we see kind of like with how the team I mean The team seemed to not be as cohesive as they could have been they kind of like was a ragtag crew of people Really good people really cool people working on it But in the end it just couldn't compete with with uni swap right because they vampire attacked Basically the king and then the the Kings like well, I'm still King like I'm still gonna keep keep building here We're still gonna keep building products out. We're still gonna keep getting adoption and that's exactly what happened with with that So I don't think open sea can be vampire attacked Without kind of like a strong team behind the vampire attacking happening and has to be like an actual concerted effort But you know, it could be the same thing where open sea basically says well, okay We got forked and they did a token and now they kind of sucking liquidity away from us Let's just do a token and it'll all be well and good. But anyway, I'm still cool to see this still cool I mean, I'm not against forking projects. I think it's it I think it's fine As long as it's kind of like an open source license or anything things like that. But yeah cool to see these from 0x months here So Lucas from Bankless put together this amazing threat on the best yields for your eith So this is a bunch of different kind of like opportunities that you have for earning a bit basically a yield on your eith So he goes through that the balancer st. Eth slash wrapped eith pool currently gives a 7% apy So this is current as at December 24th. I don't know if it's changed since then It's only been three days but yields in crypto can change quite quickly But yeah balancer labs as teeth we pull is currently paying out 7% eith denominated yield mind you Then you have your own which is paying at 8% you have token reactor, which is also Or token Mac Which is also paying out 8% up to 70% if you have toke rewards included in that ribbon finances stf covered core vault has 28% apy And then I had redacted he says yeah has over 60 API which is hint uses Uniswap v3 And always outperforms Ethan a bull market And and then you've got like a link to a blog post here with the best yields on eith USD and BTC So these are all risky and come with their own kind of like trade-off security risk some Impermanent loss depending on what you're doing and obviously all the trading options is not risk-free that can be very risky If you don't know what you're doing But it's really cool to see that there's like a much bigger ecosystem these days on earning on your eighth, right? Look, obviously you can do staking with your eighth and you can earn five to six percent on your own We know just staking on your own or you can probably stake through something like lighter and then restake your Stake lighter in a pool on a liquidity pool and get more APY like that Or you could do the same thing with rocket pool with your are eighth and stuff like that But you know vanilla eighth staking is about five to six percent each denominated, right? It's not USD denominated is eighth denominated which as I've explained before if it goes up like 2x then that yield is basically 2x because essentially you've got the the eighth denominated yield and then you've got the eighth price increase against USD as well Which is really really cool And you know, there's gonna be more opportunities as time goes on as well I mean there there are plenty out there just depends on what your risk tolerance is and You know, it's in permanent loss that comes into things as well. If you're providing liquidity on stuff with options There's a risk of things expiring worthless and you know If you don't know how options work as it just kind of reading up on them before getting involved there But this just speaks to what I've been saying a lot of you know for a long time about how eighth is just is incredibly Productive asset you can earn a yield on it. You can obviously use it for fees. You can kind of like stake it You can use it as collateral within d5 and if you're not owning a yield on it, like that's the thing as well You can basically put your eighth into like a money market borrow stable coins against it and then go earn a USD denominated yield Or what you could do if you're feeling especially risky put your eighth in a money market borrow USD against that go buy more eighth, you know leverage up on eighth and then put that eighth Into something to earn yield on it or you could just kind of like borrow eighth depending on what's most capital efficient and do all That sort of stuff there. Obviously, there's liquidation risks there and all that all that stuff there So it's it's you know, it's more risky, but the higher the risk the higher the reward, right? We all know that but anyway go give this a blog post to read. It's published in Bankless from Lucas. Yeah It was it was a good one So Cain from synthetics put out a tweet a few days ago yesterday I think we said last week I sent an email out to six projects offering them a mentorship in exchange for a commitment to launch On optimism. I wanted to keep it to three, but I honestly couldn't decide which ones to cut. They're all great I'm going to turn it into a program and publish it and then he says l to 2022 And yes, I will be encouraging them to all a launch via alien protocol So Cain has been doing a very big push to get more and more projekt projects onto optimism, which I think is solely needed I think you know There's three main things when it when I'm thinking about kind of like L to adoption that needs to happen First one there needs to be a token right like all these ecosystems that you see get lots of TVL Lots of kind of liquidity and users they all have token incentives. This is just how we're going to bootstrap usage of anything Altos l1 site change whatever it is token incentives are the best way to bootstrap things So that's got that's the first thing there Second thing there needs to be a concerted push from community leaders to get projects to actually launch on these things that the merits need To be explained to them basically it inherits a theorem security and decentralization While offering cheaper fees and they will get better over time and the ecosystem will grow over time and then you may get some token Incentives as well added on top of that. So there really needs to be a push there Like I'm pushing it all the time. Cain's been pushing it a lot There's a lot of other people in the etheric system that are pushing it but we need to keep doing that and doing it in a big way and And thirdly the actual infrastructure and the actual teams building these l2s need to really push on the marketing and business development Themselves they really need to do a polygons been doing I know I'm gonna go on about polygons marketing a lot But they are kind of like best in class when it comes to this sort of stuff There's a reason why they have pretty much everything on the POS chain And that's a large part due to their business development and marketing efforts They really truly understand that that's that's kind of like how to um to grow an ecosystem coupled with token incentives them diplomatic token incentives originally on the POS chain and then they kind of built up a base and now it's It's a kind of being them Who steady growing instead in and steady growing and I think the polygon POS chain is actually the most used chain Even more so than these other alt l1 so it works right marketing business development. They work really well Goes hand in hand sometimes with token incentives Like I think token incentives can be a form of marketing business development as well Get a lot more attention on your project get a lot of people involved that when people kind of like on there and there's some Sort of sticky liquidity that kind of like stays around once those token incentives taper off or go away completely So I'm hoping to see more of that in 2022 As Kane says here l2 2022. That's all we're all kind of like pushing towards as I said before I think within the next six months three maybe even 36 months all the L twos are going to do tokens Especially in reaction to what's been happening with other L twos that already have tokens. I mean metis is a fork of optimism I believe they have a token and that tokens gone pretty ballistic in price, right? and they have a big army now on Twitter that I've been seeing people just basically shilling them all kind of like shilling shilling has A negative connotation attached to it But I mean it as in like kind of like talking about them a lot promoting them getting projects to deploy there all that sort Of stuff so that's a strong thing But also I think the technology is just going to keep getting better and better exponentially better in 2022 and we're gonna have a lot more projects launched there, which is going to you know give um Give users something to do because at the end of the day the users are gonna go where the products are with the money is With the incentives are and we have a really be really awesome opportunity to do this with l2 and take a lot of those users back from the alternative our ones Well, not only that because as I said before the fact that we're fighting over a small set of users right now It's kind of like missing the forest for the trees I think what we need to do is focus on the new users pouring in And and that's kind of like where the centralized exchanges come in with their onboarding as well And I would say that that's kind of like the fourth pillar. Maybe there's more than three There's the kind of like three major pillars for l2 adoption The fourth would be the centralized exchange bridging and Fiat on-ramps which basically go hand in hand I think we're gonna see a lot more of that happening in 2022 as well to capture those new users Not only the existing users that we have out there today So speaking of Fiat on-ramps arbitrum announced that banks are Now allows users to convert their fear to crypto that can be used on arbitrum one. So this is just another Kind of I guess option for you guys if you want to go straight from Fiat to Arbitrum, I'm sorry to crypto and then to then to arbitrum one, which is always awesome to see I mean these smaller ones are cool. Like I think it's all additive But man, these centralized exchanges are dragging their feet. I really hope they're kind of like just doing it You're gonna do it in January in February I really hope it doesn't take until like mid year for them to do it because it really needs to happen I think even with token incentives on these L twos It's still not gonna be enough to get the users that we want on boarded because the l1 gas fees are pretty high now Obviously if there's token incentives people will be like, okay Well, I'll just eat the l1 gas phase because I'm gonna make it back with these token incentives But the token incentives can't last forever and and I you know I don't think these L two should be do like overly aggressive ones either They should do you know kind of like big ones get some kind of like headlines around they get some marketing from it But I don't think they should do it in such a way that I basically just attracts like extreme amounts of mercenary capital They're just that just leave after it's done but I also hope that they have more kind of like bridges into these L twos before they even do it because if they don't What ends up happening? Is that I think it's just gonna onboard the existing users rather than the new users and what we want are the new users I'm the existing users have already used kind of like a theory arm They've probably already used many of the L twos at least tried them in one way or another But we need the new the new users the millions the tens of millions of people that will come on chain over the coming years hundreds of millions we need them to To kind of use these technologies and that's kind of where we get the real benefits from but they won't use it Unless there's an actual bridge from their centralized exchange to to the L 2 so I'm hoping to see more of that In 2022 and speaking of Fiat on ramps layer swap it has now added zk sync to their portfolio So you can now bridge 8 directly from your binance coinbase keu coin Ku coin hobby and more account to zk sync without losing on gas fees and it's fast You can go to layer swap dot IO to try this out now layer swap I believe is a centralized service that basically is an intermediary that sits between a centralized exchange and the L 2 and will basically take on the The cost for you because they're taking kind of like a fee on that It's an option for you guys to use but just be just keep in mind that it is like pretty centralized But at the end of the day like so is a centralized exchange, so it's kind of like okay Well, they're both centralized. What's more risky depends what centralized exchange you're coming from like I would consider You know ku coin much more riskier than a coin base for example I would consider hobby much more risky than a binance because it's based in China for example So I at least I believe hobbies based in China or maybe or maybe Korea, but somewhere where there's heavy regulations They know hobbies always been in the news about heavy regulations, but still it's all based on your risk preference I mean pretty much everything in crypto is based on your risk preference But this is just another option for you guys if you want to directly Kind of on board on to zk sync or other L 2s from centralized exchanges So slingshot has now been deployed to optimism. This is this is pretty quick. This is pretty fast So really really glad great to see slingshot on optimism here So as you guys know if you've been using slingshot before on the polygon POS chain You'll know just how you know how smooth it is to use They've got like decks liquidity with centralized exchange performance real-time charts for every token and a positive slippage and their video is always pretty cool Here so you can go check this out on optimism. Just another way for you to trade on there I believe they're on Albatrum and I mean they're on polygon POS channel believe they're on Albatrum as well. They're gonna be everywhere I mean, this is the thing about these apps They're pretty much going to be everywhere But it's good and and the winners are going to be determined by a variety of different things of like the winning kind of implementations on the chains I don't think there's going to be that many is going to be a handful for reasons of outline previously such as I Mean the overhead is pretty extreme to maintain like imagine you're a developer or a team of developers or a Dow Trying to maintain like 20 different Implementations of your your app and trying to update them and try to keep them on the bleeding edge It's not going to work. So and and and really I mean It's not going to work for the end user either. So I think what's going to happen is going to be a handful of winners And then that you know that that's just going to be how it is like how it's um in the mobile world Like how is only the iPhone the iOS app store and their Android play store and there's a few other attempts out there I know Samsung had their own store for a bit and there's a couple of other smaller ones But they don't really go anywhere, but it might turn out to be there's more than just two dominant platforms within crypto I believe there will be like I don't think there's only gonna be two dominant L twos or two dominant L ones Um, yeah, but yeah see and then I kind of like think about this as well It's kind of like the L ones you guys know my views on the L ones is that they all have to be settlement layers Or else they're kind of useless like even the ultra scalable ones are not going to be able to outperform Ethereum's L2 ecosystem when it really gets going so for me, they might just they might only be two settlement layers You know, I don't actually think that needs to be two I think one makes enough sense, but they probably will be at least two maybe even three, but I don't know I don't really see it but in terms of like execution layers the L twos and things like that There's gonna be many of them but in terms of like the winners it's gonna definitely be look like a um a Power distribution where 90% of the activity will just be on a handful of them And then the rest of them will kind of fight over that last 10% there So my high low from our polygon announced that Stephen Curry has joined the polygon family with an NFT collection So this is pretty cool a polygons NFT drops have been pretty big lead with had Dolce and Cabana They've had NFL have had draft kings Macy's and a bunch of other brands launching on there So as I said guys, this is their business development team at work. This doesn't just happen, right? It's not like these big companies have all gone to polygon and being like we want to do NFTs on you some of them may be but a lot of it's got to do with having like a dedicated business development team or teams that go out there talk to these brands build relationships and actually get these things to launch on Polygon instead of somewhere else like these kind of like big companies. They are just looking at one solution They look at many other solutions many different solutions and whoever has the best pitch and whoever has the best business development Team and who is the one that on boards them? So polygon really does I mean immutable X is also another example of a great Business development team that has been able to get big brands on board such as tick tock and and other ones like that But polygon yeah, I mean he's just killing it in that in that kind of area, too So it's a cool to see this I believe I think I'm saying his name right Stephen Curry or maybe it's Stephen Curry I don't follow the NBA, but I believe he's a popular NBA player But but yeah, I I this is really really cool to see here from from polygon So no so safe has now been deployed to optimism as I said last week guys optimism removing their white list means that the floodgates Have just been open we're gonna see so many things deployed, you know slingshot now No so safe, which is a staple for a lot of teams before they can actually deploy to optimism because they use nurses save as a multi SIG For their kind of like for their admin keys that they use, you know, if they're early stage projects So nurses safe being on there means that a lot of other projects will probably migrate across now I can't wait to see them all go across as I said, I think January Q1 in general is gonna be pretty big for crypto especially for a theorem and especially for l2s We really are just on the cusp of like a huge year for for altos. I am very excited for 2022 for a theorem I know that 2021 has been a weird year for a theorem where it's funny because we have like a massive run From like 700 bucks to 4400 in May And to Maeve at the start of this year and then we had the crash and then since then it is kind of like hobbled Around $4,000. I mean going up and down hasn't really done much since May in terms of price But it's done a lot on the fundamental side of things but at the same time there's been other l1 ecosystems that are pumped a lot in price because of a theorem's kind of like quote-unquote failings in the scaling department But I think because a theorem has been trying to scale the the right way right the decentralized way It's taken longer but we're finally there and I think 2022 is going to be the year where a theorem actually takes the scaling narrative back in a really big way and Allows lots of users to onboard and experience a theorem without the expensive fees and you know The funny thing is these other l1s are allowing users to experience a theorem without the high fees because they're EVM's right like for example The avalanche seed chain is an EVM chain Phantom's even compatible as well. There's a few others out there that have even compatibility. It's basically all a theory. I mean just on It's not the ethereum blockchain, but it is a the theorem experience what you have you met a mask you have your kind of like your either scan like block explorer you have the same kind of You UX just generally from there in terms of how to do transactions and gas and all that sort of stuff So I I think people are gonna really enjoy the same experience on optimism and arbitrum And we also need to kind of like keep pushing the virtues of how they're deep You know these things inherit ethereum security and decentralization They are better than these alt L ones from that perspective and I think we will especially when they have tokens man When these things have tokens, it's gonna be such a narrative shift It's gonna you know You're gonna break your neck just trying to catch the narrative shift because it's gonna go by so very very very quickly And you know from one day to the next it'll just be all a theorem scaling You know buy this token and all this sort of stuff. So so yeah Anyway, cool to see nurses save on optimism here and the last update comes out of diversify So if you're looking to buy crypto with Fiat on l2 Heath well you can because diversify is integrated with moon pay So basically moon pay is acting as a fiat on ramp for diversifies l2 ecosystem So just another one of these Fiat on ramps. They're all coming. They're coming in waves. Everyone knows that we've needed them I'm actually really surprised that we're getting the Fiat on ramps earlier than we're getting the centralized exchange on ramps Because as I've said to you guys plenty of times it's such low-hanging fruit for these centralized exchanges to do this It's an in-demand thing their customers want this people are asking for it and yet they're dragging their feet. Whereas these Fiat on ramps like that aren't centralized exchange I mean they they kind of are centralized exchanges But they're not like the coinbase or the finances of the world. They're kind of just like a a fiat portal So to speak rather than an exchange. They're just beating them to the punch. So they're gonna get a lot of users out of this I believe And and also the l2 is that they're supporting are going to get a lot of new users, too And that's what we love to see when we see these kind of like Fiat on ramps and and stuff like that But anyway, go check this out. If you're a user of diversify or want to be a user of diversify It's an easy way to get on boarded there, but I think that's going to be it for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel If you haven't yet give the video a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the discord channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow Thanks, everyone

 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily wave refill where we cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host Anthony sasano and today's the 9th of February 2022 Everyone let's get into it. so basically today I put out a tweet and this is the kind of like topic of today's newsletter where I said 99% of people who own crypto never use the product that the coin slash token is associated with They buy things based on narratives usually spread by the big boys of the world This is who you were trading against just being on crypto Twitter puts you ahead of almost everyone now I first off I had a few replies to this saying that the bit boy fans and other kind of like youtubers like people If fans are on crypto Twitter, I'm gonna be honest guys. I don't actually consider the bit boy Crypto shill side part of Twitter crypto Twitter. I consider crypto Twitter to be the fundamental side, right? And that's a very kind of like small circle So I think that the definitions kind of get it kind of got a little bit Mumbled up there or jumbled up there. But yeah, that was kind of like my point there But I guess my overall point is that I've explained to you guys that people kind of like buy these tokens and coins on centralized exchanges keep them there and Barely any actually end up using the on-chain products, you know I've seen some estimates of there being hundreds of millions of people that have you know own crypto on a centralized exchange And that's all well and good, but that doesn't mean that they're actually using the on-chain products and most of them haven't You know if you go and look at some statistics around this So the total number of unique if your image addresses is eight out one hundred eighty seven million at time of recording Now we all know that people have multiple theorem addresses. It costs nothing to create and create an etherium address there I mean technically all the theorem addresses are already created But it basically cost it cost nothing to kind of like having to have a new one besides like the fees I think the way a the scam registers it is that you have to have like at least have had something interact with the On-chain with the address before it will actually actually register it because as I said technically all the theorem addresses are already created It's just when you interact with it. It means you've got the private key for all that good stuff there Sorry 187 million and it and I mean it doesn't cost nothing But it basically just cost the gas fee or cost an exchange fee to withdraw some some evil tokens to that address to register it Now in saying that people have many many different addresses like I alone probably have used God at the very least 50 addresses just just on my own that have actually had on chain interactions Not to mention all the centralized exchange address at theorem addresses that I've used over the years Which I don't count as part of that 50, you know You can have multiple addresses on some exchanges and they are definitely counted in that Not to and then you kind of like take into account like all the bots and things like that Really realistically the amount of individuals that have an a theorem address is is quite low and I actually think of a good way of I guess like measuring super active individuals or on chain individuals is ENS names now I think last time I checked ENS names that were actually tied to an address and resolved to an address was maybe a couple hundred thousand or something like that So I think that's a pretty accurate kind of I guess measure of more people on chain at least in the ethereum ecosystem Obviously there's other ecosystems But you know if I had to kind of like take a stab here of monthly active Ethereum kind of like users or monthly active on chain users we have stats from metamask where it says, you know There's there's tens of millions but that was during like I guess the the the months where the the market was very bullish today if I had to guess like the the the Active users over the last month of any chain probably a few million maybe maybe at that I mean, you know It couldn't be much less than that given that the market quietened down a bit now I would actually think if you're counting a lot of um, the men people who are using metamask To connect to kind of like other chains, especially to things like BSC which was like a retail casino if you take away all of that Yeah, I mean I I wouldn't be surprised to see it even at less than a million of right now You know because the markets so quiet So taking that all into account the 99% figure that I quote here is rather accurate and it's probably too it's probably not enough because 99% you know 100 million minus 99% is like around a million, right? So if you kind of like take that as an extrapolate that out There's probably more than 100 million people at this stage around the world that have bought crypto in some form or another I think From estimates that I've seen but as I said most of those people have never used anything on chain and you know I've got a perfect example here that I thought of before Cardano went to a hundred billion dollars in market cap without smart contracts I if I remember incorrectly which means that you couldn't do anything on the card and our blockchain except for sending assets So we're sending Ada to and from I guess like different addresses and most of the time the Ada being sent was done for arbitrage between Exchanges and all that sort of stuff there and maybe some people kind of like we're throwing a cold storage but not not very mean So from that perspective They were probably millions of people who owned Ada because it was just like retail's favorite coin Like I'm I had my friends dad's asking me about it. They didn't ask me about eat. They asked me about Ada Um, so so from that perspective, they would never use anything on chain, by the way They're literally on like the most centralized of centralized exchanges buying these stuff based on you know A newspaper article that they read like funny enough right or some kind of like mainstream article that they've read That is to me the perfect example of you're kind of like I guess token or coin can have Millions and millions of holders with near zero users, which is quite I mean amazing when you think about it And it kind of like illustrates just how early we are on the on-chain side of things and it kind of illustrates how you can't Just look at people buying kind of like crypto assets as an adoption metric. I actually don't think that's a great adoption metric It's it's fine for the prices and it explains why the market gets very very very ahead of the tech But it doesn't give us any kind of accurate indication of on-chain adoption now of course if in the future a lot of the on-chain adoption is done by our third parties and kind of like centralized intermediaries such as the exchanges offering I guess like windows into defy and they're just using one address to process all of this sort Of stuff then it's gonna be even harder to measure measure that but in terms of like actual on-chain users doing it themselves There's not that many people and that's a major reason why we're still early and as I said a major reason why the prices Get very very detached from the actual on-chain usage so I just wanted to kind of like hide that something definitely to think about and keep your kind of like Keep your eye on when I start seeing this kind of like shift That's when I'll start thinking that way, you know, not early anymore But this shift is gonna take ages. I mean, you know, like let's be frank. Most people get into crypto to make quick money They don't give a shit about anything else initially But at least when they first get in like most people some people do but most people don't right Most people or at least pretty much everyone that has ever asked me about crypto in real life Don't know it doesn't not doesn't lead with the tech they leave with the market side of it They say oh, you know, how do I invest or what's right my money into okay? You know kind of kind of like what exchange should I use all that sort of stuff? It's never you know, what can you do with this technology? What does it enable? Like what's different about it compared to this blah blah blah, and that's fine You know some people I kind of like get that side of things like and to be honest Like not everyone's gonna be interested in this sort of stuff But I mean it just kind of like illustrates to you the point that I'm trying to make here Is that there's a massive? Detachment from what who is actually buying crypto and centralized exchanges and holding it there and who's actually using on-chain things So you can go look at any metrics or stats that you want for on-chain stuff. You can use doing analytics Nansen coin metrics Some glass node any metric you want for on-chain stuff and it'll show you the same kind of like picture That I'm showing you that on-chain users are very very low and some people might say oh, this is bearish, right? Like where are all the users? I think this is bullish you guys It means that we still haven't even tapped into really the early adopters of this sort of thing yet and getting them on board Which means that we have so much left to build there's so much opportunity left There's so much opportunity for you know If you're doing on-chain stuff for you guys to make outsize returns because you're trading against these people and trading against does it mean that you're actually kind of like Directly kind of like shorting someone that going along on something or long something something someone short on it What it means is that you're able to get into things much earlier than other people are and you're able to ride them up If you know obviously if you hold and you have conviction on it before someone else discovers it And this is exactly what happens with pretty much everything like eighth for example You know for the longest time eighth kind of like stayed below I guess like 10 20 dollars right for since you know went live mid 2015 It was still $10 early 2017 and then it obviously blew up and all those people who kind of like adopted You know early on and actually even sat through things like the Dow They were laughing if they just held and didn't didn't sell obviously it was very hard to hold during the Dow and stuff like that And it was a very different time back then but same applies to 2019 and you know 2020 when when eighth prices were much lower And this applies to so many other things not just eight there's so many instances of these guys where the alpha the real alpha is Just doing on chain things you may not you may think it isn't But I believe it still is and I believe it will be like that for quite a while now At least it will be kind of like in bull markets right now It's a little bit of a PvP environment as I discussed the other day where? There's not many kind of like retail users flooding in or anything like that So it kind of becomes just the same money sloshing around which can be quite Quite shitty and quite hard to kind of I guess like play around with but if you're a long-term investor You don't really care for that sort of stuff so so yeah anyway moving on from that one on to the next big piece of News I guess like the biggest piece of news of the last 24 hours was that two people have been arrested in relation to a Massive hack that happened in 2016 to the centralized exchange bit for next so this was huge news back in 2016 I believe it was a hundred and twenty thousand BTC that was stolen Our current worth is three point six billion dollars Which is obviously a massive amount of money now for those who don't know the tldr of this is that there was a hack that? Happened in 2016 they weren't able to ever track down the hackers until today and the way bit for next actually made up for The loss that they suffered because I wasn't obviously a massive loss is that they socialize the losses so they cut everyone's the Holdings on the exchange by 36% so they took 36% to like make themselves hold That's what it means by like socializing the losses which obviously shit for people who had money on the exchange But this is just another reason why you should never keep your coins on a centralized exchange And then they promised that they would kind of like create a new token called Leo And then they would use that token to kind of like repay I guess like that I mean I guess like if you want to call it a debt right or repay kind of like the The losses that were socialized there and in the original white paper for for Leo They basically said that if the BTC was ever returned they would use I think a part of it or maybe all of it or something to kind of like purchase back Leo from the market until Everyone was kind of like made whole there at least. I think that was the wording of it I may be getting that wrong misremembering it there, but You know that's why I guess like the Leo token has been pumping the last few days And you know it kind of like makes sense there But I guess like the other thing I wanted to talk about with regards to this is just how crazy it is like I'm sure You saw on Twitter today all the kind of like craziness especially with the arm the woman involved So it's like a it's a husband and wife pair so the wife led a very interesting online life She did a lot of different things like she was apparently a rapper She was apparently very involved with cybersecurity and kind of like advising bit go on stuff and things like that so very Um I guess like involved life there and people were like couldn't kind of looking at this finding a tick-tock finding an Instagram post and Being like how is this person the bid for next hacker? Um and then it was like there's so much around this I mean, I'm not gonna rehash it all here But there was so much going on with this today And I woke up to this and I was like what the hell like this is crazy And I wasn't around in 2016 I came in in early 2017, but this hack was talking was spoken about for a very long time Because it was just such a big deal and obviously there was the MT gox hack, but that happened in 20 hack I mean I guess with MT gox it was kind of there insolvent for a while because BTC kept being stolen, but that happened in late 2013 early 2014 sort of thing there And then funny enough in mid 2017 there was another major exchange that actually got some got shut down BTC II where they were kind of like I guess a bunch of Russian guys running this and they got kind of like shut down by The FBI for money laundering apparently with funds connected to MT gox these there's been some sketchy history with centralized exchanges Especially in the early days if you want to kind of like read up on this It's actually a pretty fun read but a lot of this is kind of like scattered around some crazy stories of all the stuff that Was going on obviously when the industry was a lot less mature than it is today But this is this is kind of like a big deal and obviously these people aren't you know haven't been found guilty yet? They've just been arrested, and it's kind of like alleged that they did this, but I guess like you know the the Justice Department is in control of these funds, so I I'm assuming those funds are going to be returned to Bitfinex since they're the rightful owner of them And then obviously the users of Bitfinex are the rightful owner of them as well But yeah very interesting a bit of news I guess and if you weren't around back then which I'm assuming a lot of you weren't Just from talking to you guys in the discord channel It seems like a lot of you guys are rather new to crypto at least over the last few years So you probably don't know how big of a deal this was and as I said I wasn't around in 2016 But this was still being talked about a lot in 2017. It was a very very big deal It was I think one of the largest hacks at the time ever since since at the MT gox fiasco And Bitfinex was was trusted. It was Bifinex was like the BTC maximalist exchange in 2016 It was like just Bitcoin I mean if eighth was this really small scrappy thing that no one really paid attention to other than you know some some small community And it was really that It was all about Bitcoin back then still and and bit and bitfinex was where a lot of Bitcoin Wales traded on a lot Of the og's traded on and yeah that ended up being like quite a big deal there, so so yeah anyway I'm not going to keep going on about that. I'm sure you've heard enough about it today I'm going to move on to the next update So I didn't see this yesterday before I did yesterday's refill, but I saw it after apparently Coinbase wallets At least their extension has launched support for trading on polygon using their DEX trading feature So you can see here what trading is like using the 0x API on aetherium versus on polygon So this is pretty cool to see I mean on aetherium it would cost you 60 to 80 dollars in network fee on polygon It's costing you two cents now obviously the polygon POS chain isn't a quote unquote true L2, but I mean at this point I don't think it really matters so we've Debated this to death. I think it's just great that users are able to get Obviously cheaper face yeah, but hopefully this is a sign of more things to come I know this isn't an integration with the coinbase exchange There's no kind of like these positive withdrawals into into stuff But they did have promised that they're going to be supporting the polygon POS chain and and things like that And obviously other L2s and stuff, but you know I know I complained about this yesterday But at least they're doing something at least it's something to kind of like tide us over But I really really hope that more integrations are coming because this sort of stuff is obviously very important very bullish when people see the Network fee has been collapsed and this would be collapsed on a On an optimistic roll up to the same trade should be under five dollars on a optimistic roll I'll probably like two or three dollars right now obviously not as cheap as two cents but with optimistic roll-ups you get the the security of aetherium and That is going going to be really great for users to see because I think you know yeah I don't know I've had this talk with you guys a lot about fees in the past and how I think this is kind of like a certain Threshold where it becomes like users starting in your heads. This is ridiculous I don't think two to three dollars is that the ridiculous mark for a lot of people, but obviously it's kind of like way too expensive You know for the longer term that's that cost is going to come down over time But I think while we're still in like the super early adopter phase two to three dollars is fine That's going to keep coming down, but like $80 is definitely not fine. That's just crazy But like people pay it right um but but yeah cool to see the coinbase wallet extension supporting the polygon POS chain here So a big announcement out of celestia today now I've spoken about celestia before there are new data availability layer being spun up they technically are a new layer one blockchain So obviously little to do with aetherium I guess on the layer one side of things but today they announced something called celestiums which are aetherium l2 chains That use celestia for data availability and aetherium for settlement and dispute resolution in other words this is very similar to stark where's validity am where the Settlement and dispute resolution and proofs and everything are posted to aetherium layer one and the data The data that that would be normally posted to aetherium layer one as well is posted kind of like off chain onto I guess in this case celestia in stark where validity am's case. It's a it's just kind of like their own thing And you know immutable uses validity am and stuff like that So yeah, I guess this is like exactly what celestia is trying to do They're trying to be a data availability layer for for layer two chains right for for things like roll-ups and stuff like that now Is it the same security that you get from from like a true roll-up? No, it's not because the data is somewhere else the data is not on aetherium it is on celestia so if something's happens on celestia, I'm then you're at the mercy of that if the data gets kind of like withheld or if the Or if they're or if the kind of like data gets deleted and you can't can't get it then your funds are effectively frozen They're not stolen. They can't steal your funds, but they're the funds are effectively frozen So it's a cool kind of like hybrid approach to achieve more scalability before we get things like sharding I think it's a good like short to medium term solution for the most secure things But I I still struggle to see why if you have kind of like cheap cheap data storage on aetherium that you would choose to store it off chain and and kind of like reduce your security guarantees here even If off chain is a bit cheaper than then on chain aetherium So we're gonna have to see how that plays out But I do think the celestia will play a big part in the kind of like aetherium scaling roadmap going forward I think their main competitor Technically is sharding on aetherium is a competitor to that because it's they're both data availability layers But also polygon avail I believe is a like a direct competitor to celestia because we've probably gonna veil Ethereum L twos can choose to settle on that as rather than Celestia and do the same thing here with a with a sorry choose To put their data on that and settle on aetherium still and have dispute resolution on aetherium as well still So I think Celestia and polygon are direct competitors. I don't think Celestia really competes with Sorry polygon avail direct competitors I don't think Celestia really directly competes with aetherium for data availability in that it can never it will never give you the same security Guarantees that aetherium L one is gonna give you and when sharding comes along and when we kind of like optimize Layer one for roll-ups further. It's gonna be a tough sell But there are gonna be there are gonna be times when you want to use off-chain data still even though you get cheap on-chain On-chain data with aetherium and this is definitely for the lower value use cases like most nft is a lower value You don't need a theorem security for most nft stuff and that's why immutable X is built as a validity M because honestly You don't have for like all for like most nft 99% of nft You don't need the expensive aetherium security just like you don't need an army to protect, you know Your everyday kind of like belongings, right? Having the I think a home security system is enough in most cases to protect your belongings But obviously you have an army to protect your nation just like aetherium is like, you know Layer one is like this nation that you have the the decentralization and security of aetherium to protect itself But like, you know a lot of apps don't need that I think define needs that definitely like finance and the things that need like a lot of security but there are certainly a lot of use cases that don't need that and that's where off-chain data games data availability comes into it and Something like Celeste here polygon avail is better than a homegrown solution Like with um, like we stock where and having their kind of like off channel like some centralized servers Unless they start competing by issuing like a token and spinning up their own validators and decentralizing that network at that network out Which I actually believe they will do and I think zk sync will do this as well as zk porter So there's going to be a battle between these data availability layers and they're all going to use a theorem to settle still so I Think that's actually really cool. Is that we kind of like gets the full modular approach here We and it's not just a theorem working on it. It's it's polygon and Celeste Yeah, it's the L twos working on this sort of stuff too. And I think that's going to be really exciting going forward So very much looking forward to that and I guess like looking forward to seeing how Celeste affairs here as well So Argent announced yesterday that you can now send from major exchanges to Argent zk sync and it's 10 to 20 times cheaper than Bridging from L1 you can send from coinbase FTX finance and more using layer swap Which is basically a centralized service to get your funds from a centralized exchange It doesn't that either supports or doesn't support layer twos yet and getting it directly from there to layer twos now as I said It's a centralized service. So it is because for as far as I know it's custodial So essentially what you do is you send like your funds from the centralized exchange to like You know going through layer swap and then layers will kind of like relay it for you So it's a good like middle ground solution. It's it's it's definitely another middleman, but I think it's kind of like it's fine But I do wonder with you know What kind of like on what what the future looks like for layer swap when these centralized exchanges all natively integrate with these L2s but maybe they are very slow to integrate with the long tail of L twos and layer swap can kind of like Have a um have a kind of like foot in the door there But there are I guess like fees associated with this as well. I think there are caps on it, too But yeah, it's a good salute It's a good solution if you want a you know If you're desperate to do this And especially for kind of maybe lower value transfers because I think there is a 0.4% kind of like fee on it So for example, if you're doing like a $50 transfer from a centralized exchange to a layer 2 It doesn't make any sense to go through layer 1 to get there because the fees are just gonna eat into everything But with a 0.4% kind of like flat fee, it's it's basically nothing right? It's like 40 cents or probably 20 cents I think I'll have $50 Whereas if you're doing like I guess what a hard $10,000 kind of lamb and transaction there I'm just doing the math in my head right now It ends up being kind of like I think more expensive or at least $10,000 one. Yeah, I think $10,000 maybe even just like $100,000 something It just depending on the percentage day It ends up being more expensive than just going through if you're in layer 1 and also the extra risk that you're taking on is Probably not great. And as I said, there's caps on it. So you probably can't like There's limits on the amount of funds you can send through so you probably can't do it anyway But still this is cool for like the lower value transfers for sure and just getting some you know 100 bucks into L2s to get started playing I think that's really cool that this service exists here and that Argent is integrated with it So last on the things to talk about with L2s, Pratik here has put together a list of people builders and projects active in the Starkware ecosystem so you can go to this Starkware CT list and look at all the people and And projects and stuff that are involved you can follow this list here if you'd like So this is a great way to keep up with the Starkware ecosystem And as you guys know the Starkware ecosystem has been growing pretty quickly lately with Stark and then things like that So definitely go check out this list if you want to keep up with it. It'll be linked in the YouTube description below So alchemy has announced another fundraise. I think they fund rose like two months ago or something like that Anyway, it's another 200 million dollar raise which pushed them at a 10.2 billion dollar valuation and the raise was co-led by a light speed ventures And Silver Lake so I guess congrats to the to alchemy here huge raise for those who don't know alchemy is infrastructure for for blockchains essentially It's an inferior competitor where it Provides kind of like node infrastructure and in order to relay transactions and in order to kind of lamb now present information to certain people And to kind of integrate with other applications that need all this on-chain information This is a big business guys like this is as big as the data analytics business is And that's why the evaluation is so high here They can you know, the funny thing is it's so specialized and this data is in such high demand that they can probably you know Charge a lot of money for it And that's exactly why people want their hands on these companies and as you guys know in Fura is part of consensus as far as I Know inferior doesn't raise on their own consensus obviously rose money Sorry raised money recently and I think they're doing another round right now and that funds and pays for inferior basically, so Yeah, I'd be cool to say this Congrats to alchemy on this race here. I'm excited to see this is a serious See by the way, I serious c-1. I think the hell ask raises a serious C as well but excited to see kind of like Excited to see them get more funding here Alright, so it's finally launch day for vesta finance. It is now live on our Arbitrum so protocol and the could incentive programs have kick-started on there and whitelisting claiming will be available on February 9th at 7 a.m Pst which I guess is happening probably already happen by the time you've watched this video So yeah you can go on do arbitrum and play around with vesta today for those of you who don't know vesta is a fork of liquidy and and basically what you can do today is you can use I think I believe three different assets being Heath Ren BTC and geom to mint vst which is the stable coin and you can see the kind of like clairization rate ratios here on minimum mint fee minimum redemption fee and stuff like that and there's As I mentioned liquidity incentive programs to participate in there's a pool to a vesta kind of like a pool here There's vesta being the the native token Vst the stable coin fracks on curve and there's a bunch of unlocks with whitelist and people who participated in the sale With obviously lots more to come now obviously disclosure here. I'm an investor investor. You guys know that I think that's the reason why you guys even know about vesta's I put it on your radar But I'm hoping that you guys you know just have another I think to play around with on arbitrum cuz I know a lot of you Play are on arbitrum right now and on our active on there right now. So definitely go check out vesta if you haven't yet So speaking of stable coins maker announced that die has achieved 10 billion dollar 10 billionth in supply So there's now 10 billion die out there, which is an awesome milestone, right? This is dies come a very very long way. I think in just in just a short amount of time You know people often criticize make off for being unscalable and for dying or being able to scale as quickly as other I guess stable coins out there But you know, I think make has always taken the the safer approach to things They've always taken kind of like the risk-off approach They definitely want to build for stability over our insecurity over kind of like speed and scale which I think is Long-term the better solution but For the short to medium term where kind of like them the I guess like ecosystem is ruled by d gens and is ruled by People who want like fast money fast gains the other kind of like decentralized stable coins will I guess get more traction get more growth But a lot of them will actually blow up a lot of them will not do what they say They're going to do a lot of them will actually lose their peg So I actually think that maker should continue on the path that they've been on with taking the slow and steady and secure approach Because honestly maker is one of the only projects out there that I trust putting my eighth into Because they've been around for so long I know they they take the best kind of like a practice approach to building their protocol They're actually properly decentralized because they've actually got like a proper Dow Yeah I mean as I said like they're the one of the only protocols that I trust my ETH into and that's because of their slow And steady approach when you're putting like your funds into these protocols that are moving fast and breaking things and doing DJ and stuff It's fun. You can do it it, you know, you can do it with a little bit of money But just expect to lose that like honestly guys. I mean we've seen it play out time and time again I've warned about this constantly I mean I saw people in the discord channel today talking about like how I've been warning for ages how it's really really hard to Outperform a few if you buy another token right and outperform over the long term and people, you know It definitely takes your own experience to kind of come to come to terms with this Because over time you see Even if you're holding like a token from like a project that you consider to be an awesome project and really really bullish it Doesn't matter because all of those tokens have worse token omics than ETH and they're gonna be outperformed by ETH And it doesn't just apply to assets on a theorem it applies to assets everywhere And that's why I you know believe that ETH will outperform most things over the longer run even though it's got a larger market cap And then even still even if you buy something that outperforms ETH by like two to three X is the extra risk you took on Worth it in that case because you usually have to take on a lot more risk when buying other things and I think in that Kind of like case we've seen this play out time and time again. It's riskier to buy tokens to invest in stuff It's riskier to use these protocols It's riskier to buy the tokens that are associated with the protocols because if something happens to the protocol then the token goes down Yeah, there's all this kind of like stuff that that happens. So I think that I love makers approach But I guess to be fair the MKR token hasn't really performed Well either against ETH over the long run and not so well against USD, but I think that's a separate issue I don't think that's what to do with Maker and necessarily not not not growing nicely not having good future prospects But I do think it's a consequence of their slow and steady approach because they're not doing DJ and things for their token They're not doing kind of like pool twos. They're not doing VE token omics they're not doing I mean there was an idea to do it floated to do it But they're really the only thing they're doing is kind of like burning excess MKR But that's not enough for the market the market doesn't really care about that in I guess maybe the short to medium term Maybe the real long term MKR ends up being a good bet But for me, I mean, I remember someone asked me in like 2019 Did I hold in the MKR and I said even back then? No Because I don't believe it's gonna outperform either the long run and it hasn't it I mean, I think I think it was like two or three eighth back then per MKR now It's like 0.7 or something last time I checked And I was pretty confident in that because I just saw all the stuff coming for eighth and I was like, yeah No, this isn't gonna happen here But anyway enough not investment advice for you guys there moving on to the last thing I wanted to talk about was just a shout out here to Matt lysing who I was on his podcast with recently called decent people We actually spoke about Mostly not aetherium things on this podcast. So this was more like the layer zero I did with David Hoffman where we spoke about kind of like my journey before crypto Well coming into crypto what motivates me and we actually went even further back with Matt where I talked about kind of like my early Life my childhood my schooling my parents stuff like that So if you're interested in learning about that sort of stuff Definitely go give this podcast a listen and Matt actually has a pot a bunch of podcasts with other people as well in the ethereum Community he really dives deep into non crypto stuff with these people So definitely go check out all of them as well. But on that note, I'm gonna leave it at that So thank you everyone for listening and watching Be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give the video a thumbs up subscribe to newsletter join the disc or channel And I'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone

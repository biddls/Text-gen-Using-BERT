 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Deligay Refuel where we cap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Stan the Nithyan, thanks for signing on and today's the 9th of June 2022. Alright everyone, let's get into it. So the Ropsten merge has happened. I was watching live on the E-To-Take-A live stream, I'm sure a lot of you were as well. It happened around I think 2.30 am my time. There was a bit of kind of like trouble getting enough hashrate onto the network in order to make TTD happen faster but we got there in the end. The merge transition went through very smoothly I think. I don't think there were any major issues. There were a few minor issues with I think Nimbus and Tequ had some configuration issues which just required a kind of a config change and a restart of the clients there and that was all well and good but the transition itself happened just fine. You can see here kind of like the picture basically of a dashboard showing it happening and then you got the little pandas there with proof of stake activated as well. So I don't know, I don't know what to say guys. Like I obviously have been talking about this for a while now and I was just super excited to see kind of like this play out. It reminded me of the Madasha testnet on the when the beacon chain, the Madasha beacon chain testnet from way back in the day. My level of excitement was insane and obviously we still got another you know two more public testnets to go into mainnet but I don't even know what I'm gonna feel when it gets to mainnet. Like I've been talking about the merge for so long and you know we've been waiting for proof of stake since basically day one of Ethereum. It's been such a long time coming and we're so so so close. But yeah it was really awesome being on the stream with everyone. There's a bunch of people on there in kind of like typical Vitalik fashion. He had a really bad mic. I think it ended up being the cable or something like that and I put out a tweet where I said Vitalik probably announced the mainnet merge date but we all missed it because his mic is so bad. So that was quite funny but yeah just generally good vibes all around. We had Jonathan Mann singing songs for us as well right up until kind of like the Ropsten merge happened. Now there's a couple of things I wanted to talk about with regards to the kind of Ropsten merge here. So this is the block explorer for the beacon chain, the Ropsten beacon chain basically. So you can see here basically the most recent epics and then the most recent blocks. So whenever you see kind of like proposed that means everything went well and good. When you know all well and good the block was proposed and the network is functioning it's all fine. And then you've got scheduled obviously that's the kind of like upcoming block and once that gets proposed there'll be another one that's scheduled. Now the epics are basically there's a one epic every six minutes to epic make a finalized chain. So when one epic is complete the chain is does what's called justifies and then when two goes through in 12 minutes the chain finalizes and we have that economic finality with two-thirds of the stake basically making sure that we can't rewrite history there or make it very expensive to rewrite history. Now what I want to focus on is this percentage here. So this is basically the percentage of validators that are kind of participating and voting on kind of like on these blocks right. Now when you kind of look at these sorts of stuff and people kind of say oh only 85% instead of like 100% right or only kind of like 80% instead of 100% or whatever percentage it is it doesn't mean it could mean two things right. Like it doesn't mean that there's like a critical issue with the network or anything like that. So what it can mean is that either the block explorer is bugging out or having issues that happens more often than not but what it can mean otherwise as well is that some kind of like portion of the network has gone offline for whatever reason and that's why the participation rate has dropped. So it was I think about 80-85% when the merge happened and that was because Nimbus and Tequo dropped off due to their configuration issues but the thing is it wasn't actually a problem with the network it was just a problem with specific clients. This is why we have kind of like the multi-client architecture so that we don't have kind of like these issues happening with just one client because then obviously the whole network would go down so the network is more resilient because of this. So I saw people pointing to that and being like oh that means the merge didn't go through perfect the drops immersion go through perfectly that's a that's kind of like a bug. No actually that's actually it functioning as intended and the configuration issue is very very simple to fix it's just you know fix the configuration restart the node or restart the validator it's very very simple to fix so that's not a big deal and you know if you go to kind of like the regular Beacon Chain website here I'll just bring it up on my other screen here I've actually got this in dark mode sorry for blinding you guys but you can see on here basically participation rate is 99.6% and that's obviously because of the economic incentive to be online and to be validating because if you're not then you're not making rewards and that's another reason why this thing would drop to maybe 85 90 or even lower than that on test nets is because there's no real incentive to do it on a testnet besides kind of like altruism right like you're not getting any monetary reward for it so why do you care like but on main net you care if you're offline you start getting leaked and you start losing ETH and you're not even you're not earning ETH so obviously it's a very bad thing so you want to be online that's why we see the participation rate being so so high here and if for some reason one of the clients is taking too long to I guess like fix their issues especially kind of like on main net then people will just switch to another client right and just get back right back into validating so the Ethereum Beacon Chain has been designed to be as resilient and as possible so I just wanted to kind of like point that out there but in terms of a full kind of like early summary of how the merge went from a core developer perspective you should definitely read this thread here from Parathosh which you which I'll link in the YouTube description it basically just gives like a high level kind of summary of what happened with the Robson merge how it went what they looked for obviously it's going to take a few more days of kind of like analysis to give like a full breakdown of how it went and what happened there but from what I can tell it went very very well I didn't mean to rhyme but there it is it went very well as I said there are only those minor issues the merge transition happened as it should and I think we can move on to a Sepolia and Girly in you know two to three weeks for I can't the thing is I'm having conflicting information about which one's next some people are saying Girly some people are saying Sepolia we're gonna have to see like which one there it is but I mean it doesn't really matter at the end of the day but yeah Sepolia or Girly and then there's gonna be a two to three weeks between those and then hopefully they will go well as well and then we'll set kind of like finally set a main net merge date which ah guys I don't even have to kind of like go on about it anymore but yeah I'm just so happy that the Ropsten merge went through so you know I mean I don't want to say uneventful but like it just went through as expected right it wasn't like we something unexpected happened it wasn't like the chain came to a halt it wasn't like it didn't work it worked very very well and there was only those those kind of like minor issues there so definitely very cool to see I'm looking forward to the full breakdown from kind of like the core developers maybe like a post-mortem of kind of like what went right what were the kind of like little things that went wrong and kind of like how that's being fixed I think there's a couple other issues as well that Parathosh kind of talks about here but apparently the fix has already been worked on for them so yeah I mean this is nothing like I did say yesterday or at least the day before that drops the Ropsten merge would kind of like give us a better indication or timelines here there is a core devs call I believe this week or next week I can't remember off the top of my head it's either this week or next week which is going to give us even more insight into it but from how the Ropsten merge went I don't think there's going to be that I don't think there's going to be any kind of like change to the timeline that I've put out so far which is the September merge but we'll have to see what was said on kind of like the core developer call which I'm sure they're going to they're going to hopefully schedule the next testnet merge on that call but yeah everything went very well guys I am so happy with how it went I am so excited the fact that we get to do this two more times on the testnets and then on mainnet super exciting like and there's going to be more calls as well I'm hosting one of them I'm hosting the Sipolia call which is either in three weeks or I guess like six weeks right so and then there's going to obviously be a call for mainnet as well so calls abound it's going to be very very fun and I'm glad you're all on board for the ride here so just before I finish up on talking about the merge related stuff we've got here Tim Byker put out a tweet saying with Robston now on proof of stake friendly reminder that many testnets will be shut down by end of the year kiln will shut down after its mainnet merge sorry after mainnet merge rinkaby won't be merged shut down by end of year and Robston is merged today obviously and shut down by end of year as well as well the only testnets that are going to be maintained post merge are girly and Sipolia so if you're a developer or anyone that actively uses a testnet for whatever reason just keep this in mind just kind of like a quick shout out there all right so related to I guess like the merge and and kind of like proof of stake ethereum in general I put out this tweet where I said it's weird that people think ethereum is hot swapping its consensus to something totally new and untested the beacon chain has been live as a proof of stake network since december 1st 2020 it will have been over 18 months by the time the execution layer merges with the consensus layer now december 1st 2020 beacon chain goes live that has all this eighth at stake and since then it's just growing there's literally billions of dollars tens of billions of dollars at stake in in the beacon chain right now yes the beacon chain isn't coming to consensus on anything except itself its blocks are empty there's no transactions in those blocks right there's nothing kind of like um of value being generated there but there is still tens of billions of eith being staked on the beacon chain right they're still at kind of like at risk if there was something wrong with the beacon chain now since december 1st 2020 there has been a few bugs here and there that have been kind of like repaired and it's been it's been mostly uneventful right like things have just been running really really well we've had we had the first kind of like hard fork on the beacon chain a little while ago that went through just fine and its next hard fork is coming up get to get it prepared for the merge and uh yeah so when people say that uh we're kind of like uh implementing proof of stake on ethereum without testing it and and it's you know it's it's as if it's something totally new that's completely wrong it's not new it's not untested it's been by the time the merge happens it'll have been about 18 months or probably over 18 months since that beacon chain went live and that's what we're kind of like hot swapping in and getting rid of proof of work obviously now in saying that it doesn't mean that the beacon chain is perfect it doesn't mean that there are there could not there could be no bugs in the future obviously we're going to keep upgrading we're going to keep introducing new things that could lead to bugs as well or there could be dormant ones that get found later but that's just par for the course that that goes for every piece of the puzzle that's why we're going to keep doing that and it's for every piece of software in the world like that's nothing unique to to the beacon channel to ethereum so i just wanted to kind of like lay it lay that out there that it's just silly whenever someone says that it's new and untested because the whole reason of setting up uh the beacon chain first without doing uh without kind of like uh just changing ethereum to proof of stake in in one fell swoop was to make sure that this this kind of like new uh uh you know uh uh consensus mechanism or a new proof of stake kind of like mechanism that had been that was kind of like uh of proof of stake was tested uh over a long period of time and and and allowed time to bake so to speak before we kind of uh put a merge the two layers together so that was the exact reason why it was done uh but yeah just wanted to kind of like highlight that for you guys all right so there was a bit of a drama around optimism today so the tldr is that apparently with their the op token they sent 20 million op tokens to a market making firm called wintermute uh and they sent these tokens to wintermute's multi-sig address which they kind of like um they created a nosasafe kind of multi-sig wallet for this but the problem was that uh wintermute created this wallet on layer one ethereum where as some of you may what may be aware the op token does not exist on layer one ethereum it only exists on layer two on the optimism network now what happens in the old versions of nosasafe which is what um what wintermute was using is that if you deploy it to layer one someone can then or an attacker can then actually deploy it to layer two and and and kelvin victor here goes through the technical breakdown of how this works in this thread here but that's exactly what the attacker did they were able to deploy to layer two which means they had technically had access to those 21 20 million op tokens that were wintermutes and basically were able to i guess sell a bunch and then they sold some uh sorry they sent some to or i think they sent a million op to vatalik for some reason i don't know it was a bit messy and of course the price of the op token has dropped because of this as well but yeah just a very um it's very weird kind of like uh exploit here very weird bug here that you don't see uh you don't see often and unfortunately this should not have happened like i mean really significantly shouldn't have happened like wintermute should have known that they needed to deploy this uh nosis safe on layer two on optimism because the op token didn't exist on layer one and optimism the optimism team should have probably double checked this right so there was a bit of kind of like failures all around i think this is kind of like the bystander effect where everyone just assumes that everything was all well and good and it kind of like went through but again everyone kind of like makes mistakes yeah i'm sure they're going to learn from this and kind of like learn this learn a very very good and serious lesson here uh but yeah just something i wanted to highlight for you guys because i thought it was noteworthy and definitely check out this thread from kelvin victor here to basically breaking down on a technical level how it works i love his threads like i'm not super technical obviously not a developer uh but i love his technical threads because it allows me to read through it and then get like a better understanding of how it all works and it's actually pretty cool to kind of like see it all broken down the way kelvin breaks it down so definitely go check this out if you haven't yet um i think the latest is that wintermute offered kind of um a white hack bounty or something and basically said that you know if you return everything uh and return the kind of like funds we'll just let you go and we'll give you like a bounty uh whereas they said if you don't return the funds you being the attacker then we're going to use everything at our disposal to basically publicly dox you and have law enforcement go after you and all that sorts of stuff there look if i was the attacker at any of these scenarios i would just take the white hat white hat bounty because when you think about it right not only are you at risk of being doxed um you're also going to find it very hard to ever cash that crypto out like the centralized exchanges are basically just going to blacklist the addresses that yes you can run it through tornado and things like that but i mean you got to do it like slowly and depending on the amount of money it is it becomes really hard and then that leaves a trail leaves breadcrumbs behind and channel analysis companies can potentially do pattern matching and things like that to de-anonymize you so it really just isn't worth the hassle and risk i think at the end of the day i think taking the white hat bounty is worth more and this is why bounty programs actually need to be a lot larger optimism is pretty big already but like in general if the team can afford it their bounty program should be much uh should be very very big because that works as kind of an incentive to be like okay well you know here's a million dollars if you find a critical bug or two million dollars if you find a critical bug in our code um you know and rather than like the attacker being like okay well i can steal 100 million but how am i going to cash it out like realistically cashing out 100 million to uh kind of like fear into getting it into your bank account and being able to spend it is going to be extremely hard and depending where you are you're going to have to declare that as um as kind of like taxable income and there's so much that goes into it right like it honestly like it really doesn't pay to be a criminal um just because you live in fear as well at the end of the day like so just take the white hat uh bounty and just take the bounty and kind of like my mind um but i guess like first don't hack projects like if you find a critical bug in it if they've got a good bug bounty program um you know that's more incentive for the attacker to report it but i think that if the bug money program is kind of like shitty say for some for some of them that the um the program is 50 000 for critical bugs well i mean if you stand to kind of like maybe make 10 million dollars out of it then you're probably going to take your chances with that because you're not going to go 50 50 000 because it's just not not worth it and i'm just trying to put my mind in kind of like the mind of an attacker here and then it depends who it is right we saw with the ronin hacker it was actually the north korean um uh uh hacker group uh lazarus right they don't give a fuck right they don't care at all they're just going to steal the fun so i think this just applies to maybe just individuals or small groups that maybe aren't kind of like nation states right because the nation states don't care uh but that's a whole different kettle of fish i'm not even going to not even going to kind of like reason about that but when it comes to individuals and small groups they you know definitely should um should kind of like consider the white hat bounty uh here all right so interesting tweet here from rodrigo who works for legal at paradigm uh where he said there's a uh there's been a lot of great content about legal rappers for dow's recently and we'd like to want to add one more to the mix the dow legal entity matrix and you can find this at dow's dot paradigm dot xyz here uh which basically gives you more detail into it but for the sake of kind of like just the video today you can see kind of like images of uh legal entities for dow's and like how they kind of like can get wrapped in these entities you can see here that with no legal entity obviously it's just dow members kind of like uh uh all scattered around there right then you have like an llc rapper which you have the dow members but then you have an llc which is a limited liability liability corporation in the us uh wrapped around that right uh and then you have other things like you know an ownerless foundation where you have a foundation that uh dow that is kind of like affiliated with a foundation but there's no kind of like direct connection there and then yeah i mean you can go through all these but basically this is pretty cool because i think as i've discussed before for the the doxed us based teams like especially us based teams they're going to need to look at this and think through this like very very carefully uh because if they want to be a dow if they want to have a token if they want to be able to drive value to that token they're going to need some forms of protection here that's the whole point of something like an llc right it limits the liability of the person or the people running the company or running kind of like any entity or any for-profit entity so from from that perspective i like seeing things like this especially when it comes from uh you know places like paradigm which obviously uh you know there's a very big concentration of like eager brains at paradigm but uh if you want more information about how all this could work potentially you can definitely check out this table here on their website which i'll link in the youtube description but this is dow's dot paradigm dot xyz here which goes into much more detail than i will today on on this episode uh but yeah i thought this is very very cool dow's is a another area that i try to pay attention to but just don't have the time to pay attention to especially because like it's exploding as fast as anything right now and i think there's a lot of noise there too just like anything right but i think you know for those of you who have watched my um interview with the steakball now uh basically my my general view on dow's is that from the highest levels people have the wrong idea about them they think that dow's are basically anarchy no no dow's don't have to be anarchy and they shouldn't be anarchy when it comes to dows they should have leaders they should have coordinators it doesn't make them centralized but you know if you have a if you just have anarchy within the dow what ends up happening is that the leadership void gets filled by the worst people or the treasury just gets raided or the project goes nowhere or the token goes nowhere like there's so many negative kind of consequences because of it so i think that having leadership and coordination within a dow is critically important to the dow and that's you know pretty much related to what our paradigm has put together here so definitely check out this it'll be in the youtube description below all right so something i came across today which is called morpho uh compounds so if you have a position on compound finance you can now upgrade your yields using morpho uh compound which is live at compound dot morpho dot xyz so basically uh it's a lending optimizer here morpho uh is a lending pool optimizer it means that by using more for one up can upgrade its positions on learning protocols such as compound or are there with peer-to-peer liquidity and today they're announcing a more for a compound here so why would you use it well as i said optimize your yields here i'm sure this comes with we're kind of like more risk and everything like that which uh i i think at this point you guys are well aware of but yeah if you are interested in kind of like uh going and checking this out and using this if you have a compound position open you can go to compound dot morpho dot xyz and check it all out here connect your wallet all that good stuff uh as well you can even claim your comp tokens through this too which is which is pretty cool to see so i just wanted to kind of like hide this because something new something different that i hadn't seen before uh i'll be keeping an eye on this to see uh kind of like how it evolves from here all right finally we have an interesting tweet from justin drake today who was comparing the electricity consumption estimates of uh of different kind of like uh entities so you got the world which is 25 000 uh terawatt terawatt hours i think terawatt hours uh bitcoin at 204 terawatt hours which is 0.8 of the world's energy usage which is pretty insane right ethereum at 85 terawatt hours which is 0.34 of the world's energy usage and then later on um justin kind of like provides some alternative sources which quotes that bitcoin is 60 lower than it is here and ethereum is about three times lower than it that it is here so the the rough big picture crypto electricity consumption is around uh one percent i guess ethereum would be what 0.1 percent of that or something like that right still pretty crazy when you think about it but but yeah it's there and this and and as on justin says yeah this electricity consumed to produce the rigs is not accounted for either and all the waste that comes from the from the rigs too so the reason why i'm bringing this up is because he put out another tweet where he said ethereum post merge is 0.000 of the world so basically the costs become negligible for ethereum kind of like post merge here and it just completely collapses it which is pretty crazy right i mean i've mentioned this before but i think there's going to be a shit ton of gpu's that flood the market the the gamers are going to love that uh there's going to and they're not going to be gpu's that have been worn down or anything like that um pollin has actually explained this before where basically with gpu's for mining they actually have to be run um kind of like underclocked because they're more efficient that way so they're actually not kind of like being kind of just beaten down and that you know they're kind of like uh not not great to use later they're fine to use later so yeah there's going to be tons flat in the secondary market but there's going to be some electricity companies i reckon electricity producers that are supplying these kind of i guess mining farms and they're going to take a little bit of a hit here right like especially if ethereum just say accounts for 0.1 of the world's electricity usage that's pretty that's that's pretty that's a lot guys like i mean i know it doesn't sound like a lot because you know say 0.1 but you're talking about the world's energy usage like the entire planet right like it's it's a lot so there's there's that aspect to it as well and then obviously the the positive narratives you know ethereum is green ethereum is no longer proof of work um and now we can kind of build on ethereum because we don't feel like we're destroying the planet all that sorts of stuff like narrative or or truth it doesn't matter right the narrative i think the narrative matters more than the reality or truth when it comes to this and i've had this discussion on the refuel before about proof of work is it good is it bad is it kind of like um is it killing the planet blah blah but i mean in my mind i don't get i mean my play of this is not to get too involved with it for me i don't like proof of stake because it's loses less energy like that's not that's not even something that i really think about too much i like proof of stake ethereum proof of stake um not not every purpose like just ethereum is pure mistake because it is such an elegantly designed system that optimizes for so many good things right optimizes for liveness it optimizes for um for kind of like uh resiliency it optimizes for security like economic security and it just makes sense right it punishes the bad actors it lets us kind of like fork out like really bad actors that are trying to spawn camp attack us and all that sort of stuff so that's that's kind of like the main reason why i'm excited about it rather than the energy used reduction which is a bonus in my mind like it's getting reduced by 99.9 percent nice little bonus but the rest of proof of stake related things is with regards to ethereum is what i'm most excited about but still cool to see justin do this comparison here again these are just like really rough estimates you can't get like an exact picture it's very very hard to get an exact picture of um the electricity consumption but we can get estimates and the estimates are still pretty pretty uh pretty high right so once ethereum grows off of work drops to basically zero percent i'm gonna love to see it right all right so uh robin here from uh liquify uh liquify which is kind of a token vesting investing uh dashboard here has put together a thread uh where he started with thinking about launching a token in this market or granting future tokens to employees and investors we did some analysis on the latest tokenomics benchmarks and trends to help you plan your critical token decisions now i don't think you need to read this just if you're kind of like planning to issue a token or part of a team that's planning to issue a token you should definitely read this because it's just a super interesting thread about tokens in general and i'll link it in the description for you to do so but basically this chart really kind of like stood out to me you can see here that this chart shows token distributions or token allocations from 2017 to 2022 on the left hand side 2017 you can see that 55 usually went to public sale which was obviously the icomania but then over time this number has been shrinking and is basically non-existent now in 2022 only three percent of the token allocation goes to the public sale or kind of like on on average here right the biggest share is actually now community incentives or distributions aka airdrops and liquidity mining then second place would be company reserves or treasury fourth is core team and third is investors so i think this is an interesting view of things right guys like when you kind of look at these sorts of stuff like people will say oh you know it was better in 2017 and then some people say no it's better now i think there's a very nuanced discussion here i don't think there's any right answer as i've discussed before token distributions are very very hard to get right but i don't think icos were a net positive honestly like just because things are available for public sale doesn't really mean anything so let me give you some few examples here there are plenty of tokens that were sold majority in a public sale or an icor a lot in a public sale and ico that are down a lot from their all-time highs or just from kind of like just in general and that's because the project didn't actually go anywhere it didn't have any product market fit it doesn't matter how good the token distribution was the project was just shit right so this is kind of like what what it's all about like the token distribution i think is important but it's kind of like secondary like the primary thing is is the product actually good because if the product is shit doesn't matter how good your token distribution is doesn't matter if you give a hundred percent to the community like the it's still gonna suck right the token is not gonna accrue any value or it's gonna accrue very little value so i think the primary thing that people should be looking at is the product itself first first and foremost right then the secondary thing is token distribution which i think is very very important but nowhere near as important as actually having a product that people want to use and having product market fit that's the most important thing out of any of these sorts of stuff right so then from there we can reason about the new the new reality of 2022 community incentives or distributions is this better than icos eh right like i mean airdrops most people just sell them the incentives the liquidity mining people just farm and dump so i mean the net results basically the same like icos basically became that people just buy and then sell on secondary because it would pump because you'd get in early and then just kind of like dump on everyone else so yeah that's all i can say and then the rest of it didn't really change since even 2018 right so investors core team company reserves i mean that's all stock standard stuff some people will argue that investors get too much some people argue that core team gets too much this is just much lower than you know non-crypto companies guys like in terms of um a share of the of the um of the company or i guess like the protocol here but i think it's that 44 percent or including the the company reserves or treasury 66 that should be the main focus here i think that's what we still need to kind of like get right because at the end of the day you need to basically make it so that on net more people want to hold and buy the token that want to kind of like farm and sell it or just sell it in general and i know that may be obvious but like that is literally the equation like how do you get more people to actually how do you produce more demand for the token then there are there is uh kind of like um supply on the market or people kind of like selling right it's just a supply and demand thing it's extremely extremely hard to do like it's not an easy thing to do like it took i mean even eth right that which today is in my mind the most bullish asset in crypto bar none still went down 94 from its all-time high from in 2017 because it went up a lot due to its kind of like hype cycle came down 2018 2019 and then went down 94 and then came back only because ethereum survived right ethereum the network survived ethereum the network actually found use cases like defi like nfts like dow's like all these sorts of stuff and ether as an asset has amazing tokenomics with 1559 with the you know with staking with with getting monetary premium all that sort of stuff so you see how that works right none of that stuff would have happened if ethereum as a network didn't have product market fit if it was useless ethereum as a network has one product it's a block space everyone freaking wants ethereum's block space that's why the fees are so high so you see how that works right the theorem product came first then the token came second now yes obviously ethereum's token distribution is is much better than pretty much you know any token except maybe bitcoin but i don't think that would have mattered and it didn't matter when ethereum wasn't actually a popular product which is during the last bear market in 2018 2019 so when ethereum did become a popular product when we had defi summer when we actually had ethereum block space commanded premium and gas fee started going up that's when either as an asset also started going up and you can map this pretty pretty closely actually so yeah just kind of like i think making those connections can help you a lot but yeah go give this um thread a read here from robin it's very very good i should disclose i'm an investor in liquify as well here just kind of get that out there but the thread is very very interesting and it's related to a lot of stuff that i think about pretty regularly as well as well when it comes to like token distributions and things like that all right so finally here

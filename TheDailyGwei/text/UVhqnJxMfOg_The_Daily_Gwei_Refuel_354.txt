 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily grey refuel where we recap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host the antes asano and taser 14th of april 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So I know I said that i'd be doing a refuel tomorrow being tomorrow being friday But unfortunately, I don't think I will have time to Uh, I have too much going on that need to get sorted before I fly out to amsterdam as you guys know i'm flying out tomorrow So just to kind of recap here because of this there's probably not going to be a refuel until may 2nd Which is the monday I get back may 1st Uh, so yeah, i'm gonna try and upload here and there if I can but there's no guarantee So i'm just gonna say that there's not going to be one and if there is, you know It's gonna be just gonna be a nice surprise, I guess and it'll probably come out at a different time Then you're usually used to the the refills coming out at um, but i'm so pumped Uh, this is my first kind of like real holiday since before covid Um, it's the first time going to a proper eath conference since eath denver in 2020 Uh, I just I i'm yeah, i'm so so so excited. So Anyway, uh, here's a recap of my plans with dev connect These are the days that i'm going to be attending so i'm going to be at eath day Uh for about half of it and then I have some other commitments to get to Uh, i'm going to be at the staking gathering. I'm actually going to give be giving a talk there Uh layer two amsterdam i'm going to be at as well and i'm going to be on a panel there, uh tbd Yeah, it hasn't been officially announced but i'm going to be on a panel there Be it i'll be at shelling point, uh, and i'll be judging the eath amsterdam hackathon and i'll be around like various parties And things like that and just around the city So as I said plenty of times if you see me, please do come up and say hello I would love to meet as many of you as I can Uh, and i'm just yeah, as I said, i'm so so so excited right now. I just I can't contain my excitement at this point Uh, but hopefully there's not many delays at the airport. Apparently the airports have been chaos obviously because it's the easter long weekend I didn't even realize that when I was booking everything and then my fiance is like, you know We're leaving on good friday. Yeah, and i'm like, oh, okay. I just kind of like I I wasn't paying attention. I'm like, oh, oh So apparently airports are a bit chaotic, but you know, hopefully I I get there And all is well and good but i'm not gonna bore you with the details there. So Yeah, I mean, I guess like after today's episode i'll see you all in two weeks on the refuel Uh, but we can we can do our goodbyes at the end for now There's a few different things I want to talk about with regards to The merge now. I know i've talked about the merge a lot lately. I spoke about the Quote-unquote delay the other day and the funny thing is if you had been listening to the refuel I think it it was either three or four weeks now where i've been saying that I I Doubt june was going to go ahead you would have been you know, you would have had this alpha before Basically everyone but on top of that you would know why right and the thing is is that I remember saying to you guys if the Kiln test net went well if it if it didn't have any hiccups and everything went smoothly Then that would be the best case scenario and we would probably get a merge in june But I did say if there were hiccups then there's probably not going to be the merge in in june and uh, there were hiccups And here we are right and that that kind of like target window of june was originally given because of the difficulty bomb Basically what ended up happening was that there was a core devs call A while ago where people where they kind of like got together and they said, okay Let's let's aim for june with the merge because that's when the difficulty bomb starts kind of like going off and then if we don't Make it by then we'd have to do separate kind of like hard fork So it wasn't actually a date given for the merge It was more just kind of like a target window, but i've explained these to you guys plenty of times before And tim biker put out a bunch of points here. I wanted to read through a few of them So, you know, he put he put like basically a screenshot with with a bunch of text saying merge timelines And then first question when will the merge happen? And this is tim's words tim biker being the person that's heavily involved on the execution eath one side as coordination very heavily involved with cordes devs, but he says there is no official date for the merge yet, but they will only be set once client teams are confident That the software implementations have been thoroughly tested and are bug free any date announcement will be communicated on blog.ethereum.org Is exactly the same thing i've been telling you guys for months at this point So I don't think that should be news to you So what needs to happen before the merge as of april 2022 all client teams have in progress implementations for the merge Which have been tested by test suites the launch of new test nets and shadow forks shadow forks run against both of them Shadow forks run against both existing test nets and the ethereum mainnet have revealed implementation issues in clients teams are now fixing these and regularly Rerunning shadow forks to test fixes and you guys know i've been covering the shadow forks since they've been happening So again not news to you Once clients work without issues during shadow forks then the existing ethereum test nets such as robston and girly Will be run through the merge an announcement will be made on blog.ethereum.org at this point again Same thing i've been saying once test nets have successfully upgraded and remain stable Then a time will be set for the upgrade to happen on the ethereum mainnet The merge unlike previous ethereum upgrades will not be triggered by a block time as you guys know It'll be triggered by ttd or terminal difficulty value or total terminal difficulty Um, and then a list of tasks to be completed before the mainnet upgrades can be found here And there's a and there's a kind of like link there. So that's basically from tim himself I mean probably one of if not the closest people to the merge so you're not going to get any closer than that at this point Uh, but yeah, I mean you guys know my my thoughts on this and there was a kind of like tweet today I can't remember who it was from. Maybe it was from domothy So someone put out a tweet that basically said, you know, we we communicate the ethereum roadmap for years We we try our best to educate we try our best to kind of like, um, how to kind of like get the right information out there and then Tim biker says on twitter in a thread that the merge isn't probably isn't going to happen in june And for some reason like everyone latched on to that like the media was all over it Everyone was talking about it and it's like holy shit. Like this is just crazy, right? No matter how hard we try bad information just just spreads like wildfire So that kind of like really annoyed me. Um, and I kind of I I do get disheartened sometimes It's not like i'm going to stop educating and not i'm going to stop doing what i'm doing but I get really disheartened sometimes where i'm like I put so much effort into educating you guys into keeping up with everything into trying to spread the right information And then you know random people can come along with bad information or negative information And that spreads just like wildfire and and most of the time it's not even accurate So that kind of annoys me to some extent but i'm not going to kind of rant about that for now There was an interesting tweet here from uh from jesse pollack who is building dow's um, and and is at coinbase Uh where he says the eth merge is likely the top five most complex technical Organizational and incentive migrations in human history not just in crypto in human history I'm actually inclined to agree with this It makes me very mad when people nitpick or attack the teams for minor timeline changes Especially when we're this close and folks are working so hard Look I know it's a bit bombastic to say that it's the top five most complex technical Organizational and incentive migrations in human history, but I think that's rather accurate for a few different reasons number one This has never been done before Never in history has a network or a network of value the size of ethereum been upgraded from Basically, what's securing it to another kind of uh, uh mechanism that's going to secure it So proof of work is currently securing ethereum is keeping the ethereum network alive running secure all that good stuff And we're ripping that out and replacing it with proof of stake That alone is absolutely massive Within computer science within computer engineering that's absolutely massive on top of that We're doing this in a decentralized way. We need all the incentives to be right there are Adversaries out there that will take any opportunity to attack ethereum to you know To to kind of like attack any of the weaknesses or bugs or exploit anything and that's why we're doing all these tests So for people to get mad that maybe the merge happens in q3 or q4 rather than happening in q2 or june or whatever People to get like really really mad about it is honestly astonishing to me It just they just miss the forest for the trees. I un I can kind of like Understand why they're mad in terms of kind of like, uh Not agreeing with it but understanding and some people like Some people actually believe that the merge being delayed means that Eth isn't going to go up or that it's going to go down because of it and I actually put out a tweet where I said The people who think that the market is efficient enough to price in quote unquote delays Around the merge are the same people who think that the market isn't efficient enough to price in the bull case for the merge It's just just absolutely stupid right like if you think that if you okay, let me put it to you this way Let me let me kind of like simplify this if you're buying eth today And one of your reasons for buying eth is because of the bull case for the merge And you believe that it's not priced in yet That's why you're buying today because you expect a return on your investment But then you also believe that any delays for the merge is going to lead to uh, you know A set off of eth or bearishness for eth how you reconcile that because if you believe the market is efficient enough to price in If you believe the market is efficient enough to do the latter then you should believe it's efficient enough to do the former But you don't so when I see this kind of thing people complaining about price This is all I think about and it really just speaks to the fact that I mean There's a lot of people in crypto who have absolutely zero patience right like just basically nothing There's probably a lot of people who have bought over the last year. I hasn't haven't really seen anything any return on their investment Um, unless maybe they bought like, you know in a low 2000s or anything like that And there are plenty of people out there who get their information from the worst kind of sources So again, I understand I understand why it is like this Not that I think it not that I agree with it not that I think it should be like this But you know it is because of that those those reasons as I outlined and the merge itself, you know coming from a kind of um Perspective around what it's going to do for the price Look guys, it's not like the merge is going to happen and then eth is going to double triple quadruple in price instantly This is so how it works. The merge is going to happen, right? It's going to happen There are people out there who think it's that I think it's not going to happen at all, which is crazy I was reading some minor threads on reddit recently and they actually think that it's not going to happen at all And it actually amazes me that they think like this because then it it actually explains the fact that the hash rate is going up And hash rate is at all-time highs because people are investing in mining equipment with the thesis that the merge isn't actually going to happen Absolutely insane to me, but you know, it is what it is But it is going to happen and then once it happens who knows how long it's going to take the price to to go up Right, who knows how long it's going to take for e to get to like 10k 20k Wherever else that that we all think it's going to go like it it the timelines are hard like i'm always long-term fundamentals based investor And I actually thought of something today and I I was kind of like thinking through because as I said yesterday I kind of want to do a video on what I look for when I kind of like invest in Things in crypto and i'm probably going to do a separate video for that When I get back from Amsterdam, obviously, um, but I was kind of thinking through and i'm like, okay What makes a good investment in crypto like what makes e different from other things take away the takeaway kind of like? You know a lot of the fundamentals, uh in in terms of kind of like driving demand What how does it stop e from going down less than other other things out there? And I think there's two major reasons one obviously is a much bigger asset, right? So to move it in both directions is harder But I think secondly and and what plays out over the longer term is that fundamentals rather than acting as a demand driver Act as a cushion for when the price is going down or the price is not going up and just going sideways And what I mean by this is that if you're an eth holder and you're a long-term investor You will look at what's happening while the price is going down and you look for reasons to keep holding right like I mean if you've been in it for a while, maybe you don't do this, but I know a lot of people that do this They'll look for reasons to keep holding Well, you have a million reasons to keep holding right now, right? Like you have the mergers is a big reason you have Everything happening with layer twos you have one five five nine burning and and and and eight Uh attracting value from that you have staking and things like that I mean there's a million different reasons to hold e and different fundamental reasons to hold e and to not panic sell or to not Sell your e and to hold for the longer term So I think that fundamentals definitely act as a as a cushion and and kind of like dampen the downside volatility Upside is driven by a bunch of different things over the long term. I think that fundamentals definitely play Play a role but I think that they they play a much stronger role in cushioning the fall rather than leading to to You know those spikes in demand and that extra kind of like buy pressure on on e or on crypto in general. So Anyway, i'm going to talk more to more of that sort of stuff in the in the standalone video that I want to do there But yeah, I mean I've spoken about the merge enough. I think at this point you're going to have to Hear about it for probably two weeks now. So just wanted to get that out of the way Hopefully these next two weeks are good. I think there will be I mean It feels like these next two weeks are pretty critical in terms of like shadow forks and test nets and all that sort of stuff Surrounding the merge, you know People are going to be together in amsterdam. They're going to be working together as well And there's going to be a lot happening there's going to be a lot of people talking about this sort of stuff So I think that taking all that into account Yeah, next two weeks are going to be very very fun around ethereum itself and around the merge, of course All right, so something that I forgot to cover the other day which I followed for a while on the review and then it went quiet Was vergil griffith's case now for those of you don't know Vergil griffith was um, uh kind of like, uh, I guess What did he do at the ethereum foundation? He was kind of like in charge of special projects at the ethereum foundation and a few a few years ago I think I think it's like three two to three years ago at at this point. He um, basically Broke or I guess like went against the ethereum foundation Went to north korea and did a presentation on how north koreans could evade sanctions using ethereum Now, obviously this is not something you should be doing uh, obviously he uh Accounted because he did it in the open the united states did not like this and they brought a case against him Now today or I think it was yesterday or the day before he was sentenced after I think it was two years or something Of a kind of like process here and he was sentenced to 63 months of A kind of like process here and he was sentenced to 63 months in prison, uh for helping north korea with crypto That's that's what's said here Um and uh both griffith and the prosecutor cited the ekraine war vergil saying it showed him the importance of sanctions us urging uh, deterring Evasions and then this guy here, uh kind of like put together I think another thread where he's talking through the whole case But yeah, that's that's what's basically come of it now I don't know the exact details of like if this includes time served and stuff like that This is this is over five years by the way 63 months guys That's a it's not a not a short time and someone like vergil like I met him only once and I met him in early 2019 and he was so friendly and such an awesome guy Someone like him in prison doesn't belong in prison in my eyes I don't know what prison he's going to be in but I don't think someone like that belongs in prison, but that's just my kind of um Interpretation of that there and if you don't know who vergil is Here's a picture of him if you if you kind of like don't remember there But yeah, it seems like uh, this I guess uh is this chapter is kind of like Ended here. We got the sentencing for for vergil and um, you know, I don't know what the exact details are There's also a hundred thousand dollar fine, of course. Um, I don't know if there's kind of um, Uh, there's kind of like a plea deals or a lot of plea deals kind of like um appeals process and stuff like that And later down the line not totally sure on all the details, but that's basically what what has come of it. So Unfortunately, uh, I think that's what people kind of like expected. He took he basically I believe he took a plea deal I believe he pleaded guilty in order for a for a lighter sentence but obviously the us wants to make an example here and wants to deter anyone else from Uh trying to kind of like teach the people under sanctions how to evade them I'm, not gonna opine on you know, world politics sanctions war all that sort of stuff I just wanted to kind of like give coverage to this because as I said I considered Virgil or I still consider Virgil a friends. I even though I only met him once but he was a very He was a light in the ethereum community and still is so hopefully once he's out of prison Um, you know who knows how long that'll be. Maybe it's the whole five years Maybe he comes out before that as I said don't know the exact details here Hopefully he he's kind of welcomed back into ethereum with open arms and continue doing what he was doing I would love to see that personally All right. So a interesting chart here from data always where they said quick tease of my next writing Uh looking at the surge of supply inflows when ethereum unlocks are finally enabled for now Enjoy a possible acceleration path with the cl ticking up and liquid staking de-risking deposits. So you can see here I mean it's a kind of a quite complex chart here But my read is basically what it's showing is the kind of like, uh data always expects the validate account until the until the possible Until the possible until sorry until unlock to just keep going up, right? and I mean it can only be up only because of the fact that uh, You can't withdraw your e right now, but he he's kind of like plotted it out here to show kind of like a Consistent kind of trend. Um, and then you can see he has plotted hopeful merge and hopeful unlock on the date So the merge between july and october and then uh hopeful unlock between jan and april of next year And then he's also got uh, the churn limits in in terms of kind of like the the validator um cues and stuff like that So yeah, this is an interesting chart. Um, I think the validated queue. I don't think it's at 14 000. I think it came down It's at 13 000. But I mean it's still been hovering around there. It's actually quite crazy Look, like i'm looking at the vegan chain, uh website right now 343 000 validators and basically almost 11 million eath staked on the dot there Uh, and there's more than that coming because of the pending validators so I think that uh, and I think uh data always is comment here about liquid staking de-risking deposits is actually very important because a lot of these New eath deposits going in are going in via services like lido and rocket pool Because of the fact that they issue you this derivative token r eath and st e which you can go use within defi and and do whatever else you want with it So you basically still have liquidity on your eath even though it's in this kind of like one-way bridge to the beacon chain right now I think that's definitely driving a lot of this and it's important to realize that but people often kind of talk about oh won't that dampen kind of like, uh, uh, the um, The demand for eath and dampen the effect of of a of a locked up eath I don't think so because these staked eath deposits they need liquidity with eath to to to have a market right because they're only I mean right now they're only really one-sided market um If there's a bank run it actually becomes pretty bad I think we've seen this with lido before where there was a a mini bank run or at least there was a large amount of eath withdrawn from the curve pool and then there was an imbalance and this is simply because Uh that eath that exists in the bigger chain right now can't be withdrawn Uh, so it's kind of like the st e you know You you do have a claim on that eath when it is able to be withdrawn but if you want it to get out now, you have to go through the um, the various liquidity pools on ethereum to trade your st eath for for eath And this is what all these derivative tokens will always be like they're always going to have to be backed up by eath and if they're Not if there's like a bank run well what ends up happening? Is that demand for eath goes through the roof because people want to get out of their staked eath token into eath and they have to Trade to do that Uh, and then you know demand goes through the river It's the same thing with with most derivatives and I think a lot of people don't realize how derivatives work Um, but I don't think it's going to dampen demand for eath and I don't think it's going to dampen Kind of like the effect of locking up eath in staking. That's for sure All right, so georgios from paradigm shared a new research post today Uh titled hardware acceleration for zero knowledge proofs And he's captioned it by saying as zero knowledge proofs become more integrated into l1s and l2s The opportunity for zk mining could grow to a size similar to that of proof of work mining fpgas Um, not asics or gpu's are the best answer to meet the unique compute needs of zk rollups So i'm not going to read to this blog post obviously, but you can check this out I've mentioned this before how I said that I think that Miners and people who have been kind of like doing hardware related stuff should very much be looking at this because zero knowledge proofs The bottleneck from what I understand right now is actually computing the proofs and this obviously requires hardware to do And the better hardware that you have, uh, the the easier you can compute the proof But obviously it costs money to do this. So What paradigm is making a bet on here or at least what georgios is kind of like making a bet on? And what I am too is that we're going to have like a massive hardware industry blossom around zero knowledge proofs and I don't think it's going to be as Intensive as something like proof of work is it's it's it's definitely going to require some some powerful compute But I don't think it's going to be as intensive as proof of work And this kind of like acts as a lifeboat for all those miners, especially in ethereum Who basically are going to be left in the dust once we you know, do the merge right literally from from block to block They're going to be left in the dust there. So they should be looking at this if you are a miner If you know miners, you should definitely be looking into this definitely give georgios blog post to read for an overview of that But I think that as more people come to realize that this is an actual opportunity as these l2s that you know The zkl2s issue tokens and then they can pay out those tokens to the you know, the people running the hardware It's going to get quite lucrative. I imagine so we'll have to see how it plays out, you know in practice But in theory it seems like it's going to be a quite quite a lucrative kind of like endeavor And there's going to be hardware manufacturers that actually get spun up around this specifically just like we've seen ASIC manufacturers spin up to produce ASICs for you know proof of work networks and things like that So definitely go give this blog post already if you want to learn more about that one Alright, so the rainbow extension is going to be launching this summer will support all browsers and as I say here is extra extra trippy So you can see here. This is the preview of the extension of the the rainbow wallets extension Obviously if you've been using rainbow mobile wallets on your iOS or Android device you would be familiar with them very nice looking wallet Very cool looking very very awesome way to view your nfts You guys know I'm not a huge mobile wallet user But um rainbow is definitely one of the ones that I have installed and I like using it from time to night even just to watch My addresses and things like that. I Do enjoy using it. But yeah, it seems like this is coming soon launches this summer this summer being Northern Hemisphere summer My pet peeve is people using seasons to refer to times of the year because summer for for me is not is not Middle of the year it's end of the year But but yeah this summer so June July August so we get the rainbow extension in June and possibly instead of the merge But you know, that's a trade-off right to nickel trade-off So, I mean they say here you can kind of like enable a bell on or alerts on the github repo for maximum alpha to see when this is going to I'm going to go out. So this is funny. It's Taylor Monaghan mentioned here Your github is literally empty except for a five-month-old emoji I look so excited to have someone take some of this market share, but like what I think this is done on purpose, right? I think they're gonna kind of like release all the code once it's ready sort of thing. So that's fun But yeah, you can kind of like enable alerts here if you want to do that, but cool cool to see rainbow making movements on their extension here All right, so I talked about sign-in with rainbow and sign-in with rainbow I talk about sign-in with ethereum a lot on the refuel as you guys know I think it's one of the most bullish things to happen within the ethereum ecosystem and one of the most exciting things being worked on WYC.eth put together a great thread today about sign-in with ethereum and how it's the first step to unbundle the login So WYC starts by saying today identity providers such as google, facebook, apple manage the entire logging experience But so much more can be unlocked by unbundling user control, data sharing and faster innovation I've talked about this kind of stuff before obviously with user control And kind of like data sharing and bringing your profile across different kind of like web services and stuff like that And you see here a nice little image that says web 2 on the left big login such as facebook and google And then you have web 3 on the right which kind of like splits up these things into key based user authentication Using your using your wallet, obviously ethereum wallet or other network wallet, public network transactions such as read write of on-chain data on all the apps that we know and love and then signing in with ethereum and web 3 login in rewriting off-chain data and you can do this with all kinds of services out all kinds of web 3 services out there In this thread WYC continues and kind of like breaks down each of these a bit more here and they work at at spruce ID which is actually working closely with the sign-in with ethereum team and building this whole thing out and building the kind of like widgets that are needed and stuff like that to get this kind of like you know ubiquitous across the web So yeah definitely give this thread a read i'll link in the youtube description for you to do so but you guys know i'm super excited about signing with ethereum and just like As WYC says yeah, i'm bundling the login. I think that's a really really cool thing. I think it's a really cool thing That's not You know a financial thing like I love that and obviously it has financial implications But I love that it's not DeFi it's not NFTs It's like pure web 3 true web 3 stuff that's actually going to lead to better outcomes for for users All right, so there's been a lawsuit Kind of like I guess a class action lawsuit lodged against Uniswap labs from someone who and you can see here Yetiwap Summarizes this by saying the plaintiff first used the exchange the exchange being Uniswap in may 2021 And first learn and make okay, let me may 2021 was the market peak guys Last year the first time I guess like technically the market peak was November but may 2021 was crazier But yeah may 2021 was the peak and first learned about Uniswap around that time plaintiff incurred substantial losses on her transactions in connection with each of the tokens And the tokens I don't know if I can bring this up because this is quite a lengthy thing But the tokens that she bought were literally like scam shit coins like absolute just like I think it's yeah. Yeah Here you go. Ethereum max scam, right? That was an actual scam rocket bunny boom, baby.io Rock, what else is there matrix samurai? I don't even know what these things are and She's blaming Uniswap labs for her losses due to this now I don't know who took this class action on like is there a law firm kind of like labeled here? This is just insane to me. This is such a waste of time like that She's not gonna win or whoever's lodging this they're not gonna win Because I mean you for a number of reasons right like Uniswap labs didn't tell her to go trade these things They don't control the Uniswap smart contracts or anyone can list markets on there It's all decentralized and it's just I feel like the judge is gonna say this is a complete waste of time Like what do you even waste? You know, what are you even doing here? Like you made an investment decision you decided to put your money into it. You can't just go and sue someone because you're Because your investment didn't work out like it's it's just it's just it's just it's just It's just so stupid, right? I just i'm laughing because like i'm just thinking through how silly this is and how someone actually got A I I feel it seems like someone got a lawyer to to kind of like take this case and uh and kind of like um Sue Uniswap labs over this I don't think anything's gonna come of this. I think Uniswap's gonna fight this and basically win I don't think there's going to be um any um Any kind of like settlements or anything like that because it's just it's just such a stupid Uh thing here and you can see here the amounts invested are so small as well. Holy shit. I hadn't seen this What the hell so the amounts invested guys, it's like 31 in ethereum max 141 in ethereum max And there's like there's multiple transactions She bought it on on 15th of um of may the 30th of may the 2nd of june the 3rd of june 16th June and the 29th of june and each time she seems to have kind of like increased her money She put like a couple of thousand dollars in here. Um, what the hell like I'm, so confused. I'm actually so confused. Uh, I think the total what's uh, it goes down here. I think the total might be Less than ten thousand or maybe ten thousand dollars something like that and she's suing over over that Wouldn't it cost her more money to do this unless you unless she was able to find a law firm that would represent her in This case and that would actually take this on as kind of like no win no charge as well Which seems very odd, but I guess it happens I mean there are ambulance chases in the law world and and that's the term, you know To use to describe kind of like law firms that do this. But um, yeah, this is just crazy She's suing over this and you can tell these are all kind of like those scam coins because look In rocket bunny she put 95 bucks and it got her 1.9 trillion tokens It's it's those tokens that like have you know This this huge supply to make the price look really cheap to fool noobs into buying and obviously she was fooled And now she's trying to blame Uniswap labs for this. I don't know. I'm laughing too much at this I'm not gonna rant anymore. I'll link this in the YouTube description so you can go read it for yourself But I think that's gonna be it for for today's episode. So yeah reminder again guys I'll probably won't be doing one for another two weeks. So I'm gonna I guess I'll see you guys in in two weeks from today I'm gonna try and upload before then it may not be a kind of like full refuel Maybe it'll just be an update for me at Amsterdam or my phone or something like that Where I kind of like talk about my experience what I've been doing and stuff like that and hopefully you guys can catch some of my talks you can check out all the schedules if you're not going to be at some a Dev connect now if you are you can check out all the schedules on the Dev connect website and to see What's going on there? It looks like it's going to be an amazing conference. So obviously I'm very much looking forward to it But on that note, I think that's gonna be it for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching you be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give me a thumbs Up subscribe to the newsletter join the disc look channel and I'll catch you all in a couple of weeks. Thanks everyone

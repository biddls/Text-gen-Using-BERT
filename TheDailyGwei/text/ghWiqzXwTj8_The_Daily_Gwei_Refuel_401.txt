 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Daily Gray Refuel where we cap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host the Anthony Sassano and today is the 7th of July 2022. Alright everyone let's get into it. So Sepolia merged successfully. Ah it's so exciting right? Like so very happy that it all went through well. I'm gonna spend probably you know half of today's episode talking about the Sepolia merge and just merge related things in general. But basically thanks to everyone for watching the stream if you kind of like watched it live or kind of rewatched it it was a really really fun stream. A lot more I guess like organized than the Robstin stream because of the fact that we didn't have any kind of like issues with hitting TTD because of the fact that the hash power was there. It was right on time basically of when it won of when the Accord apps wanted it to happen and it happened. And also Sepolia is a permissioned test net which means that not anyone can just sorry the the beacon chain is a permissioned test net. So not anyone can kind of like jump on it's kind of like white listed and things like that. So it was a bit smoother of a kind of like transition there as well. But yeah I mean the chain finalized like there was initially post merge a few kind of like issues around about 25 to 30 percent of the network not proposing blocks and that turned out due to be to be due to a misconfiguration error as usual with these things. What's funny that for the last few test nets it's really just been configuration errors. It hasn't been anything kind of like merge related and they were fixed quite quickly and then we're back up to well we're basically back at 95 percent participation now 94 percent. Now the reason why it's not close to 100 percent I mean one it's a test net so you know if you're kind of like on a test net even in a permission test net you have less of incentive much less of an incentive to keep your nodes online because there's no money on the line right it's just test net eth. Whereas on main net you know the validator participation is at 99.7 percent. So there's only 0.3 percent of validators that are offline. So obviously a very large kind of like chunk there. But essentially if you kind of look at this now 94.5 percent and the missing validators as well rather than kind of like just the ones that are offline due to this just being a test net. There's also a bunch of keys to validators that were lost I think when this was spun up which means that those validators are basically dead validators at this point but they will get kicked out eventually of kind of like the validator set there and then maybe we'll see this creep up to something like 99 percent as well. So I do want to kind of like break down a little bit kind of what happened there are a couple of threads here one from Terrence who's one of the founders of pry labs here. So his summary was basically merge it was a success 25 35 percent of validators went offline because of this misconfiguration issue there was no client bug these hiccups will obviously not delay the merge and this is what test nets are for to basically show these kind of like edge cases that I guess like people don't kind of like account for. Now the kind of like issue basically was with the configuration is that I think there was like a ttd override and kind of like some kind of like other things got to do with that. I think no I think it's only the ttd override for this particular test net there have been other configuration errors but basically the ttd override kind of like happened because this is a test net this is probably not something that will be done on main net. So when you kind of like look at that sort of stuff look at it from that perspective this is really just a test net thing. So it's kind of funny how that works where we're finding these things on test net that aren't really going to be an issue on main net like we want to find things on test net that would be an issue on main on main net but we're not finding any of that because it seems at this point like we're literally just going through the motions like the merge transition you know I think the core devs and researchers pretty much are happy with where it is today they know what they're doing we know we kind of like have it have it down to like a nice exact science at this point and there's only one more public test net left right there's girl girlie left which I think should be scheduled on the not the core dev call this friday but the core dev call after that so the one on the 21st of july that's when they'll schedule the the girly test net merge and then it's main net and then we're done guys like that's how close we are right now we have one more public test net left then we have main net now shadow forks will keep happening every week uh parry confirmed that last uh night on the stream so that's all going going well as well there doesn't seem to be any issues with those things besides the configuration issues that always seem to kind of like pop up here but as I said they're not merge related and what I mean by merge related is that we're looking for kind of like something that goes wrong during the merge transition like a consensus breaking bug or something with the clients breaking because they just weren't talking to each other due to some other kind of like merge related thing uh but it's just been these configuration things which is obviously hugely positive now this brings me to one other thing that I wanted to talk about which is timelines I did mention in the dailyware discord yesterday that I've revised my timeline a bit here uh due to uh kind of like this configuration issue now as I said it's not merge related it's not something that is going that kind of like is related to the merge transition itself it's not something that would break the merge but I think that my read at least is is that core developers now want to give people even more time to make sure that their configurations are correct and that everything's up to date and everything's kind of like smoothly going to smoothly transition over because on main net it's very different to the testnets and there are things you can't test for on main net ethereum uh that uh sorry on the on testnets that exist on main net ethereum one of those things is all the infrastructure that exists for main net ethereum all of the exchanges the service services all the middleware everything that sits around ethereum main net that just simply doesn't really exist for testnets and obviously the user side as well and users actually kind of like interacting with the chain and using the chain and and uh putting transactions on the chain so there are just some things you can't test for even with the shadow forks right like it's just there the shadow forks don't have that infrastructure that the um that main net has and the infrastructure needs to be updated like if the infrastructure providers are running their own nodes and they don't upgrade those nodes or they don't have the right configuration set then they'll get kicked off the network um they don't need to kind of rectify that so i expect this to kind of like happen anyway i don't expect look look i i think even if this kind of like happened on main net where 25 to 30 percent of the validators uh went offline or were kind of like offline and then came back online a couple of hours later the biggest impact that would be felt is because of the fact that there's missed blocks the user experience would degrade for maybe two to three hours where there would be long block times essentially because there would be like say two three missed blocks in aurora which is 36 seconds and then you'll get confirmed on the fourth block but then the transactions would build up and everyone will be trying to outbid each other and it could get like it i mean it depending on how many blocks are missed it could get like a bit nasty with mav and things like that but generally people will be much quicker to get their validators back online as well because of the fact that they're losing eighth right there it's kind of like a monetary incentive there i even though they wouldn't get sliced for something like this they definitely would have like that inactivity leak and if it's a they're a big staying operation that can add up very quickly obviously so because of that i think that they're going to want to give people more time for girly to prepare for girly which i expect to at this point in time happen about early mid august i i think mid august might be more likely because if it gets announced on the core dev call on the 21st of july they may want to give people at least two weeks and probably look to play it on the safe side three weeks so that would bring us to around mid august now in terms of main net i would i would imagine that they would love to give people at least a month right at least a month uh if not six weeks so that would bring us to late september instead of mid september it could still happen in mid september it just depends how fast girly gets done but i think that they just want to give people enough time maybe an extra couple of weeks then that otherwise would have given people to make sure that everyone updates because it's better to just kind of run through a transition as smoothly as possible rather than having to fix things after the fact but again it's not a huge deal like i mean the beacon chain has been built to be very very resilient against these sorts of things the chain was still finalizing and the reason why it was still finalizing is because more than 66 of the network was still online more than two-thirds of the network was still online and proposing and as i mentioned the biggest issue was that kind of like degrade degrading of of block proposals which is degrading the user experience so that would obviously not be fun it would be a few hours of pain there'd be a lot of fad as well because from people who don't understand how the beacon chain works they'll be like oh my god like 33 of the network went offline or 30 of the network went offline big and chain is doomed all these sorts of stuff when in reality that's not how it works and i know that you um people that listen to the and watch the refuel know that's not how it works um but yeah on the timeline front of things yes there's only girly left until mainnet but i just feel like they want to give people more time and there's also the execution layer and consensus layer forks ballot tricks for consensus layer and uh paris for execution layer which will get those two layers ready for the merge uh basically they're going to happen to very little fanfare it's basically the same thing as a difficulty bomb delay like it's really nothing to to write home about but once those are in then we can set like obviously the ttd and then the merge mainnet merge transition will happen at that ttd like it has happened for the test nets now leading up to the merge we are expecting a bit of kind of like minus to fall off i mean a fair bit of minus have already fallen off the network due to the fact that the eath price went down so you've probably noticed a bit of hash going offline but i feel like come august there's going the smarter miners the ones who actually think the merge is happening are gonna probably begin kind of like uh i don't know either offloading their gpu's or setting up future sales of their gpu's maybe they want to mine you know right up until uh i right up until kind of like the merge happens but definitely would expect to see a hash rate drop there this is what ttd was created for by the way like for these kind of uh these these things that are going to happen with miners it was created to kind of prevent any kind of like minor shenanigans like attacking the network or anything like that but that's basically in my mind very very very low chance of happening i don't think it's really going to happen at all but the i guess like the the other thing is the fact that miners start going offline before the actual transition happens and we want to make sure that the network can run through the transition and i don't think that's going to be an issue either i think there are definitely going to be people mining right up until the merge and because of ttd it kind of like lessens the blow there as well uh even if kind of like miners go offline and i think as well miners some gpu miners are going to get kicked off the network as well because of the fact that the dag which is the um the the basically mechanism within etash is what uh is what kind of like um ethereum uses for mining i i think it's going to kick out four or six gigabyte cards uh from the network so anyone who has a gpu with that much uh vram will be kicked off and they'll have to mine with uh kind of like a eight gig 10 gig 12 gigabyte cards from there so there are there is going to be a drop in hash rate but don't be alarmed about it that was expected that's the reason ttd exists um but yeah the main net most transition i'm expecting probably late september at this stage and look as depending on like how much time the core devs feel like they want to give people and give kind of like all this infrastructure and this ecosystem uh kind of like people to update their nodes it could even push into october but i would say that's a low chance like i think people just want they want to get it done but it's more about kind of like getting it done as safely and as cautiously as possible and just being kind of like uh being on the on the safe side of things right like making sure people have kind of like upgraded in time making sure they're not left behind but at the end of the day the test net recovered very very quickly here like within a two to three hours you could imagine main net uh recovering even quicker than that because of the fact that there's real money on the line and i would assume that most people are going to make sure that their um their nodes are up to date and their earnings up to date but i would expect the core devs probably wanting to give at least a month's notice from i guess like uh when they announce the date till the date actually happens or when they announce ttd to when it actually happens uh if not six weeks which if girly happens early to mid august and then we get a main net uh kind of uh merge uh date shortly after that i would say it would push into to kind of like late september there but we're pretty much there like as i've said before we can see the light at the end of the tunnel we're just running through the motions one more public test net left uh got the paris and baltrix forks to happen which again are nothing special they'll happen with with little fanfare and then the main net merge uh happens and like i just i was kind of like looking at this tweet actually this is this is something that i want to talk about this tweet from um trent van epps here and he basically kind of like showed all the testing all kind of like the major testing efforts in order for the merge so we started with rayonism and now i spoke about this a long time ago i'd actually forgotten about rayonism this was born out of a hackathon i'm i think proto lambda and a few other people kind of created this and this was a way to initially test the merge transition then we had m4r we had kintsugi kiln we've had the girly shadow forks one to four main net shadow forks one to eight merge dev nets one to six ropston sepolia and now we've only got two things left girly and main net plus of course the shadow forks that are going to be happening every week but that's kind of like the regular cadence right up until the merge transition happens there but like i find this just really really amazing because we've tested the merge so much at this point guys like look how much testing has been done and not just the same testing different types of testing and testing on new test nets testing on existing test nets doing shadow forks which are basically a new thing for the merge transition we didn't do shadow forks before the merge uh before we started testing the merge which is actually quite wild because they're really really cool things um to do and they gave us a lot of insight uh but like there's two items left on this list now girly and main net i know i'm i'm kind of like you know repeating myself here but like for me for someone who's like spends his whole life in ethereum and following this so closely for so long now like when i got into ethereum in early 2017 you know proof of stake was one of the main reasons i got into it and was so excited about it because i was like oh my god like if this works this would be really awesome for this this and this reason um and then i watched it evolve over time i watched all the trials and tribulations in real time i've been a part of every single major event that's happened uh with with regards to proof of stake and we are literally just a few months away from the main net merge happening from ethereum being a full proof of stake network and we can uh kind of like move past all of the shitty narratives that surround proof of work and i've mentioned before how i don't have a strong opinion on proof of work uh if it's good or bad i think that if people want to fight the proof of work fight in in kind of like the mainstream they they're more than welcome to i encourage them to do that but i'm just very glad that ethereum won't have to deal with that because ethereum has enough things to fight like i mean come on guys like we don't need that one just hanging over us we i'm just glad we're moving to prove a stake for that reason but also for every other reason that that you guys know by now uh but yeah so close uh i'll keep you guys updated on the timelines here but as i said i think girly will be early to mid august at this point it's definitely not going to happen in july like i just don't say i mean it's already july 7th as i said they're not actually talking about it until july 21st because the core dev called tomorrow they'll be talking about the sepolia merge and lessons learned from that and all kind of like related stuff to that i think dang sharding is actually getting spoken about as well so i expect girly to get a date on the 21st of july which will put it early to mid august in my in my eyes probably closer to mid august and then main net probably late september or something like that which again is there still very close it's july july august september like it's like three months like three and a half months or something uh it's gonna go quicker than we then we kind of expect i'm looking forward to it obviously and i can't wait to to kind of like see it there but i think that is it for most of the stuff that i want to talk about with regards to sepolia there is the uh song that jonathan man did uh the song a day man on um on the sepolium live stream that we did he basically uploaded it to twitter here it's about eight minutes and 30 seconds all the lyrics for the song came from the deligay discord channel which was really really cool and he added some music to this as well so if you want to go listen to this you can there's also an nft you can bid on i'll link this in the youtube description below for you to do so all right so speaking of proof of stake we now have 13 million each staked in the proof of stake deposit contract of course this is main net this is not the test net and this is still worth almost 15 billion dollars like i know the eath prices come down a lot it was worth a lot more once upon a time but the thing is is that you know we all expect the eath price to go back up so as the you know more and more eath gets staked it can't actually be removed for at least six to twelve months after the merge because withdrawals aren't enabled so this number could get quite quite wild we could actually get to a point where we have a hundred billion dollars worth of eats securing the beacon chain before withdrawals are enabled if the eath price uh you know goes crazy again i mean you can imagine us getting to 20 million eats staked and the eath price is like 5k i mean the eath price was almost 5k uh as its last all-time high um and then we would have a hundred billion dollars worth of eath staked obviously like i got no idea what the price is going to do um but you know you could imagine a world where that kind of happens which would be quite quite cool to see but just awesome to see that there's still people kind of like staking still people going into staking i mean if i go to the kind of like beacon chain website here we can actually see uh so i've got the sepolia beacon chain site up there now i've got the main net up here you can see you know we're at 400 almost one and six thousand validators uh there's zero pending validators right now uh but you know there's um 13 million eats staked there and as i said like 99 you know look 99.6 99.5 participation here which is which is obviously what we want to see and that will kind of like consist after the merge transition as well you know even if there's configuration issues they'll get fixed and then we'll just go straight back to to this year so that's that's basically what main that's going to be anyway uh and speaking of kind of like uh i guess like staked eth here there is a um a great little uh great kind of like tweet here from uh from michael i believe his name is where he shows the st eth price has been recovering since mid june and the discount to eat is now less than three percent so you can see it on the chart here what the discount got to i should have bought some like i saw it get to like not 0.93 ish and i'm like ah like i should buy some here because there's so many distressed sellers right now i don't think it's gonna go much lower than here but i didn't i could have got like you know a free bit of eighth there but i didn't but that's okay i still bought eighth you know it's not like i'm out of the game um but yeah and then michael continues by saying large selling stopped entirely after celsius and the st liquidations interestingly no large buyers either just smaller ones bringing up the price increment incrementally so it's pretty cool to see that the smaller buyers that might mean that there's just a lot of enthusiasts a lot of retail investors who saw this trade and they're like well i'm gonna take this like yes okay it's it's got some risk attached to it but it's really relatively low risk and you know that you can redeem st eath for one eath once the kind of um the withdrawals are enabled on the beacon chain which should happen as i said six to twelve months after the merge and if you're happy waiting if you're already like uh kind of um uh someone who's long e someone who's bullish on e for the long term then this was a great deal if you if you're kind of like happy taking on that that little bit extra risk and you're happy kind of like waiting it out until it matures at beacon chain withdrawal there so cool to see that this is recovering of course obviously some users got hurt from this especially if they panic sold it thinking that it was going to death spiral like a lunar and ust which is something that a lot of people were saying they thought like because we just had the terror collapse everyone was speculating that everything that was quote unquote pegged to something was going to death spiral we had people fighting tether we had people fighting usdc where people going after all the other algo stables which to be fair you know most of them do go to zero pretty much all of them go to zero actually as soon as they most pretty much all of them have gone to zero um but as i've explained before st is an r eth another kind of like liquid staking tokens are completely different they're collateralized by the e in the beacon chain like just because you can't withdraw it now doesn't mean you can't in the future it's not under collateralized or unclutter allies like some of these or all of the algorithmic stable coins out there so just wanted to kind of i guess put that out there and yeah cool to see this recovering hopefully the recovery continues all right so i mentioned this ama that the ethereum foundation research team is hosting it's happening i mean it's probably already live by the time you're watching this so definitely go check it out if you haven't yet i'm sure there'll be answers up there already i'm looking forward to this as i said yesterday these are always great there's always very very informative and pretty much i think everyone from the ethereum foundation research team is going to be there all the people that you hear me talk about a lot on the refuel such as justin drake and dan krad feist here um of course vitalics going to be in there i mean oh wow dan krad actually has a tweet here listing them all danny ryan um xiao wei wang uh who's this uh asn who i actually am not following that must be a newer research a newer ethereum foundation researcher um and and ansgar here as well who i believe is a newer researcher too but yeah the who's who of ethereum kind of foundation researchers it's definitely going to be a good ama you should definitely go check it out i'll link it in the description again here all right so uh this account dino eggs on twitter has put together a last little uh image uh by any captioned it with my take on polygon security spectrum and where each solution lands from standalone chains to fully secured roll-ups now the reason why i think this is a really good graphic is because i think people still get confused about polygons uh suite of applications or suite of products i should say and where they all fit in so you can see on the left hand side here and my camera's covering it but on the far left it says not secure and it's not secure it on the horizontal axis here and it's got uh not secured by ethereum as you can see on the bottom secured by ethereum they've got polygon edge uh with like right at the kind of like not secured side of things because polygon edge doesn't talk to ethereum um at all besides kind of like i guess the bridging and people can post data there if they're an l2 but it is not secured by ethereum's validators or miners then you've got the polygon pos chain which is a bit further on the spectrum that the polygon pos chain has its own validator set but it also checkpoints to ethereum so you know if you had to you could reconstruct it from from the checkpoint so there it is it is secured by ethereum at least a little bit there then you can move uh further towards the right of the secured by ethereum uh horizontal axis here and you can see validity and and in falling to that is volitions as well and polygon avail uh sits there which is the data availability layer oh so i got confused between edge and avail edges the ssdk uh i believe uh polygon avail is a data availability layer um that's where data gets stored on a veil and the proof gets stored on ethereum so it's like a half secured thing i mean don't quote me on saying half secured because it it if you're going to go into like really deep semantics into this it gets it gets funny and researchers are going to yell at me for saying that so don't quote me on that but the i think still think this does this paints a good picture and illustrates uh kind of like how it works so polygon avail obviously data availability on polygon avail proof for um kind of um validity and volitions on ethereum uh and then the volitions uh that kind of like fall into that can also choose to store their data and their proofs on ethereum which is a fully secured chain fully secured l2 chain as we know they're called roll-ups and this is where four of um polygon's products fit into polygon hermase polygon miden polygon nightfall and polygon zero so that's the spectrum for you guys to kind of like look at and i think the reason why this is so great is because you can quickly use this to to show people hey you know polygon is a polygon does have layer two products but it's not technically the pos chain it's actually these things on the on the right hand side and then you can educate them about uh kind of um data availability and data and proofs and things like that but it's really cool to see that actually most of polygon's products fall on the fully secured by ethereum side now obviously not none of them are alive in any real capacity yet i think her maze is live on um kind of like mainnet same with nightfall but they're not obviously you know they're not used nearly as much as the polygon pos Chinese but the plan is obviously in the future for them to be to be used as much as the pos chain if not more especially as as we add more data availability to ethereum layer one so that they can have cheaper transactions to be secured by ethereum there so yeah just wanted to kind of highlight this because i thought it was a really really cool graphic so speaking of polygons uh kind of stark solutions here or layer two solutions here uh brendan who is working on polygon zero put together a great tweet thread where he starts off by saying the recursive starks pioneered by polygon let us paralyze proof generation and reduce latency but what's really cool is that they allow us to exploit a space time trade-off this lets us do crazy things like proving 100 kekak hashes per second on a laptop now this is getting a little bit into the weeds well a lot into the weeds of the cryptography side of uh kind of rollups here and of things like starks it's a short thread if you want to kind of read it but i think from my read what he is saying here is that uh paralyzing kind of like that proof generation and reducing latency allows us to basically do this proof generation on a laptop on a lower powered device which is what we want to work towards because as i mentioned yesterday i think the day before there's going to be asics for that prove these sorts of things so at the sorry that prove um starks and snarks and all these zk related um cryptography here and if we can get like really really efficient asics we can be proving a shit ton of these things in and kind of like i get um zk rollups to be extremely cheap on the proving side of things and essentially get them to the point where we can scale like up to i don't know hundreds of thousands millions of transactions per second that's where the craziness kicks in and i've talked about this before how i think that we're going to get there it's going to take a little while uh probably a longer while than we would like just because this stuff is bleeding edge it's using our new cryptography obviously whenever you do that you want to be very careful with it but we're there the path is there we know what we where we want to get to and there's so many teams working on this obviously not just polygon there's so many teams working on uh stark snark zk rollups all these sorts of stuff uh obviously stark where it's in their name right uh and then you have like uh scroll when you have uh zk sync and you have a bunch of others out there i'm sure arbitrum and optimism are also looking into these sorts of stuff too so yeah just really really cool to see that uh you know we're already getting to a point where this this kind of stuff goes beyond theory and starts going kind of like going into practice which is definitely what we want to see because that's what users care about at the end of the day right all right so i just wanted to quickly shout out again the dailygue tv account here so this twitter account is maintained by zk ben who a lot of you may have seen if you're in the discord channel he's quite active in there but for those of you don't know the dailygue underscore tv account on twitter basically shares short clips from the refill about 30 second clips and also extra information uh from kind of like the refill as well so kind of like links and things like that so definitely go follow this twitter account maybe you are kind of like miss the refill maybe you want to share one of the kind of like things that i'm talking about on the refill to your friends in in a short bite-sized clip well this is what you can do on with these kind of like dailygue tv clips yeah this has been going for i think since june now so a couple uh i guess like six weeks almost now or five or six weeks and zk ben has been doing an amazing job so obviously very big shout out to him there uh but yeah this was just put together by him i didn't even ask him to do this or anything i didn't ask anyone to do this he just went hey i want to do this he asked me and i'm like yeah sure man like go ahead this would be awesome so if you're not following that account it's linked in the youtube description for you to go follow it please do if you even if you just even if you're not even interested in the clips you just want to support the the account obviously if you watch the refill every day you probably don't need to watch the clips but if you just want to support the account you can follow it get that follow account up so more people find it more people find the dailygue ecosystem and we can grow as a community as well there but i think on that note that's going to be it for today so thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give it a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the discord channel and i'll catch you all tomorrow thanks everyone you

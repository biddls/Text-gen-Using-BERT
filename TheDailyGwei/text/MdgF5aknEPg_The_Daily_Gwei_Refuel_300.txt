 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the dailygue refuel where we cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host Anthony sassano and there's a 25th of January 2022. All right, everyone. Let's get into it So a great tweet from swag to miss here today where he basically tweeted out I'm definitely not the only one who thinks 2k It is cheap six months from now it goes deflationary while virtually all adoption metrics go up only Main net l2s defy TVL NFT volumes up and to the right This isn't 2017 when we were unsure about this whole crypto experiment. This is Sparta and then he continues with JK This is a different time. Just take a look around and you'll see everybody building cool shit. We'll be fine We are gonna make it now You know you guys know that I basically preach this to you guys all the time that Really how different this this time around is to back, you know 2017 2018 and even 2019 to an extent You know, I'm sure you've heard all the stories from a lot of the og So you basically say that this time around there's just like a night and day difference We have all these applications happening. We have all these people building on it. We have all this money investing It's not kind of like a question of will crypto succeed if it will succeed It's kind of like when is it going to succeed and everyone's kind of like convinced that Crypto is the future and that if you're him is the future and that we're all going to basically be Essentially kind of using this in our everyday lives going forward, especially over the next kind of like decade as this adoption cycle continues So from that point of view I mean looking at the price of eight is irrelevant in the short to medium term long term the price of eight should reflect the Value of the Ethereum Network should reflect the utility of the Ethereum Network and should reflect the amount of people adopting it over time That's that's actually held true Since the theorem is kind of Genesis event the more people using it and all people getting value out of the network The higher the price of eighth goes like over the longer term, of course now short to medium term It's anyone's guess what happens, you know, I know we had like a little bit of a balance over the last 24 hours But I'm not writing home about anything until we kind of like get back into a more bullish momentum But at the same time I'm not really in a rush to get back there to be honest Like I don't think it should be rushed because every time we rush to get back it We just kind of like come back down I mean I think what ended up happening after the May crash is that we rushed to get back to all-time high went to a new All-time high of 4900 and then we never really came down because it was just too quick I don't think we were able to build a base long enough I think it takes longer than what we what we kind of did even though I Remain like incredibly bullish after the May dump still and I'm still obviously bullish now But I was I was more short-term bullish them for whatever reason but but now I'm not as kind of like short to medium-term Bullish, I think that the markets need to kind of cool down a bit especially outside of the Ethereum ecosystem So many scams so much kind of like crap pumping so many things becoming like stupidly Overvalued for where they are and kind of like their adoption cycle. That's how we needed this but as swag Nimes points out here. It doesn't matter what the ETH price is doing in the short to medium term The Ethereum network is still growing in six months. We're going deflationary and we've been deflationary a lot recently And we've even had deflationary weeks, which is crazy, right? Like I don't think anyone expected us to have deflationary weeks before we went to proof of stake But it's pretty crazy And we're also I think at all times or at least most of the time we have less issuance than than Bitcoin now Because of the fact that effectively a IP 1559 was more than a halfening was like a 70% net reduction So basically since 1559 went live the if you're in network has had less issuance than Bitcoin Which is you know, a pretty pretty funny thing to think about and then you have everything else right the L2 adoption happening that There's a lot of L2 news today actually that I'm gonna talk about you have DeFi TVL keeps going up You know TVL is gonna go up and down based on the price as well But if you kind of like look at ETH denominated TVL I think that's going up across layer 1 and layer 2 NFT stuff I mean the NFT stuff seems to kind of like be that detached from the the broader market because of the fact that there's just kind of like So many different kinds of people in there and there's a lot of people who do NFT stuff that will never touch DeFi They might not even be buying ETH to speculate on it They're probably just buying it to play around with NFTs and things like that and for gas phase as well, of course So there's that happening and then yeah back to swag missus point about how this is in 2017, you know, the biggest thing in 2017 Unironically was crypto kitties towards the end of 2017 That was the biggest thing happening on the ethereum network back then besides the eighth price going up but in terms of like actual like applications that was it and that clogged the network and Compared to today's NFT environment crypto kitties was like a blip. It didn't even matter now Like I mean no one even talks about crypto kitties now But yeah, it's like a blip and and the high fees back then are literally kind of like very low fees compared to what we see today But you know, obviously the NFT ecosystem is much bigger than it was then DeFi, I mean, I pretty sure make it down and went to main net in December 2017 Which is obviously one of the first DeFi products Uniswap didn't hit main net until 2018 I believe or even 2019 I can't remember exactly but definitely not 2017. There are some ICOs in 2017 that led on to be DeFi projects like 0x for example that has the 0x ecosystem and matcha But really I mean DeFi was like a niche within a niche like no one was talking about DeFi back then I mean the DeFi term didn't actually come come to Come to be until I think August 2018 I believe it was before then it was just kind of like talking about financial products on a theorem and it wasn't just you know Wasn't described as decentralized finance with DeFi or anything like that But but yeah, we've come very far. We still got very far to go but always great to kind of like reflect take stock of what's Been happening You know over the kind of like last few years what's happening now and what's gonna happen into the future? So I think as swag them assess here We're gonna make it nothing fundamentally changed for a theorem of a life of a last kind of like few months as the price has trended down And I you know obviously over the long term I expect the eighth price to to can you do trend up as the ethereum network Continues to get adopted as we get roll arts of things like L twos and things like that But yeah, very exciting times. I'm gonna leave it at that on to the next update so the ethereum.org Twitter account shared a pretty I guess like Important post today called the great renaming what happened to East to where they basically go through their rationale for removing all references to the e2 terminology on ethereum.org now a Regular daily a great refill watches and listeners will know that I've been talking about this for a while and how if the eighth one And e2 terminology I've been using it, but it's not the right terminology anymore because we've kind of like Branched off into these terminology of execution layer and consensus layer, and I've described before how execution layer basically refers to what we have today With eighth one essentially like what we all use today right where we have like The EVM that we all kind of like interact with that executes our transactions and then e2 is has become the what's called the consensus layer Which is basically the big beacon chain right the proof of stake beacon chain now If this becomes a lot more clearer and a lot easier to explain when you know post merge because then it just becomes the execution layer And the consensus layer which equals just one ethereum So you have the EVM that we all know and love today that we play around with on what we refer to as layer one As the execution layer and then the consensus layer is proof of stake the beacon chain all well and good there So but this post basically goes through you know where did the e2 ethereum 2.0 e2 terminology come from it's been part of the kind of Like a roadmap terminology for quite a while now I mean Vitalik's been talking about it for ages as well and they kind of like go around like why you know Why can't we use e2 there's a few different reasons? It doesn't really make sense to you know, I mean, I think it's a really good idea to use e2 Different reasons it doesn't really make sense to use the terminology of e2 And how does this up? How does this update change the roadmap? Well, it doesn't I mean the roadmap that you guys have seen a Lot of times, you know this graph here from Trent van Epps and the roadmap that Vitalik's put out recently That remains the same like just because the terminology changes doesn't mean the roadmap does and obviously we have the merge coming up And then after that, we're looking forward to sharding vocal tries a bunch of other stuff happening on the ethereum I guess like it's called the execution layer side of things but also on the consensus Us a layer side which I'm gonna talk about in a bit as well We're tired put out an interesting post today on that So, I mean I highly recommend giving this blog post to read it's it's it's a great little breakdown of kind of like why we're Moving away from the e2 terminology. I know that there's gonna be you know, these big youtubers that keep using it They're also gonna keep saying things like e2 is gonna fix gas fees or solve gas fees I really hate that there are big youtubers who should be more informed spreading this narrative and you guys know This is like the number one narrative that I hate the fact that people are saying if to all the merge are going to reduce Gas fees when the topic is a lot more nuanced than that and the merge isn't going to really do anything for gas fees It's gonna give us a slight bump in capacity because of the faster block times But I don't expect that to actually be materially felt by anyone I mean the only time that you materially feel gas fees going down is when network demand kind of like tapers off due to Maybe kind of like bearish price action or NFT mania dying down But generally you're not gonna feel it due to some slight capacity increase. I believe it's like an 8% capacity increase That's nothing guys. Like I mean it really is we have like a 25% one Increase with the gas limit I guess like a few months ago that got eaten up within weeks within like a week or two And we did feel that for a little bit But at the same time it coincided with the market kind of cooling off and the NFT stuff cooling off as well So it's kind of hard to pinpoint where where that was coming from But the funny thing is is that gas actually went into the single digits, right? It's as early as I think like six or seven months ago. So when you kind of like think about that It's it's kind of crazy. But um, but yeah, anyway give this blog post a read I'll link it in the YouTube description for all of you All right back to the layer to chat So Emilio from our they put out a great tweet thread today starting the thread off with We can already do a lot to improve transaction cost on optimistic roll-ups without relying on EIP 4488 now you recall recall EIP 4040 44 48 was the air people forward by Vitalik and a bunch of others about kind of like reducing the gas costs of the Call data that roll-ups use by about 5x to give them 5x more comes as scalability But this isn't going to be coming till after the merge So what else can teams do to optimize their code for optimistic roll-ups? Well with our v3s roll-up specific API's They're going to be dropping the transaction cost from 1.5 to 2 dollars at 250 way to 0.16 to 25 cents at 250 way Estimated that's a crazy in Efficiency jump and this is not going from layer 1 to layer 2 by the way. This is the efficiency of Of optimistic roll-ups alone and this is at 250 way Which isn't the normal way price that normal way price most of the time is what 80 to 120 way? I think is the range most of the time so, you know less than half this this year So you're gonna have like sub 10 cent are there kind of? Interactions here for for certain transactions and then Emilio goes on to explain this in his thread here Which I think I think was really cool. It's a bit technical But you definitely give it a rate if you um, if you're if you're technically mind or a developer You know understand when what are you saying if you understand terms like store and slowed? Well, then you understand his thread I believe but yeah, this is really cool This goes back to what I was saying a few weeks ago and what I've written about in the newsletter before about how? Teams can optimize their code for these new environments, even though they're kind of like EVM compatible and EVM equivalents They're still very different in that there's certain things you can do to reduce your cost because of the way that core data is Treated and how that's posted to layer one and these improvements and these optimizations are only gonna get better over time Just like how there's there's been optimization optimizations made at layer one for gas costs So to at layer two and the funny thing is is that they all compound together as well. Like you can have optimism doing their own Their own optimizations on the core protocol work on the on the optimism network Which kind of then flows on to all the apps and flows onto all the users and then the apps themselves can optimize as well So they're gonna get these costs down so much and then when we have a IP 44 for 88 Implemented when we have data sharding things like that like even optimistic roll-ups Which are the more expensive roll-ups at least right now are still going to be you know Sub 10 cent transaction fees on on complex transactions, which would be pretty crazy I mean, I've said to you guys before that I believe 10 cents to a dollar is a sweet spot for Most users in the first world countries but I think that's you know getting that much cheaper than that obviously if you want to Kind of expand this technology out to to third world countries and poorer countries out there the people who really need it Especially defy we need to get those cost bet to basically free and the thing is we will we can have like hybrid Constructions of this stuff as well He validity ems and and and and and other kind of constructions where the security may be maybe lower But the thing is the transactions are basically free and we can even have like full-blown roll-ups with free transactions As long as the activities any activities enough to make up for it You can like kind of make the transaction fees off The the fees that are tied to the actual app like what the way DX does so There's lots of different ways we can do this stuff guys and it's coming and it's coming really really quickly But I think this is just super exciting to see that our there's already making you know v3 specific Kind of optimizations here and v3 isn't even live on the optimism or arbitrum main net yet So can't wait to see this go live and pretty sure it's going to go live relatively as soon So in a related actual actual kind of like topic to what I was just talking about with l2 is and kind of optimizing over time texture had a great tweet today where he said my parents used to pay 50 cents an hour for 14.4 kilobits per second internet it took minutes to connect and we couldn't use the phone went went online Photos took minutes to load people who don't remember this have basically no context for where we are in crypto I've spoken about these so many times on the refuel about basically how early we're on the technology side But this perfectly encapsulates it Imagine if you were using dial-up internet or 56k modem internet back in the late 90s early 2000s and you were thinking to yourself damn like is this is this as good as it's going to get like this stuff is Is not scalable like the and kind of like a resigning to bit basically being like well, you know, this is broken That's what a lot of people do with aetherium. They see the high transaction fees today on layer one They don't know about layer two and they automatically go aetherium is broken aetherium is unscalable Nothing's working and they don't realize how early we are to this technology because I think in today's world We've gotten to a point where people don't understand what being early means because I mean think about all the people who are born Who have been born over the last 10 years or so, even though even the last kind of like 20 years They've only really known a world with the internet in it And especially I mean as they are kind of like on to their teenage years where they become a lot more active on these things Because they use it a lot more kind of like in their everyday lives. They've only known good internet, right? They've only known being able to connect to Wi-Fi wherever they've gone. They've only known social media They've only known things being free to them They haven't known the pain that some of people like that are that are my age or older than me would have experienced like I Experienced all up. It sucked. I had like a 25 gig limit, which was actually a large limit back in the day And I think this was in 2006 or 2007 And it was it was really bad like it And and the thing is I kept capping that I was doing was playing like a bunch of games I'll playing a lot of World of Warcraft It would work up didn't use much data But I kept capping that and your internet would slow to a crawl when you reach that cap. It was horrible like absolutely horrible But like back then like yes people complained about it they thought it sucked and I was too young to realize what upgrades were coming but The upgrades came now we have fiber internet in a lot of places right where it's get gigabit per second internet But unlimited amounts of data and it's relatively cheap as well. So technology gets exponentially better over time I think more people kind of need to realize this when it comes to blockchains, especially when it comes to a theorem scalability roadmap I know I'm preaching to the choir here But I think this is something that you should use an example when talking to people about these sorts of things basically say to them Hey, you know, we're really early on the technology side of things There are other kind of like chains that may quote quote unquote be more scalable But they sacrifice certain properties to achieve that and it comes back to bite them I mean as we've seen over the last few days comes back to bite certain networks So I think from that point of view It's actually an analogy that a lot of people can kind of resonate with but I think the the younger crowd may not resonate With it because they didn't experience it. There may be something that you can kind of like I guess some I know guys for them. Maybe something got to do with the video games or something that they kind of like into I'm not sure because I'm funny funny thing is like I'm not old right? I'm like 29 turning 30 this year But I've got no idea what like the teenagers are up to I don't have I don't have kids or anything like that I don't really know any teenagers. I've got no idea what goes on in their life But if you do if you've got you know, possibly teenage kids, maybe you're you know, listening to this You've got teenage kids or no teenagers You know try and see what they're into see what pain points they have in their lives and then you can kind of like use That I think as kind of like an analogy for them But you know if they're into crypto a lot of them wouldn't be but yeah, I just kind of like spitballing there But yeah great tweet from texture here kind of for going through What well, I guess like how early we are on the tech side of things in crypto So a Rari capital has and has deployed fused to arbitram So I I think I brought this up the other day that were teasing this so fuse is a permissionless money market So now you can do from permissionless pool creation on arbitram This is one of the major money markets that have gone live on our which obviously are there is a live on their Love on there yet So I think fuse may be one of the biggest if not the biggest money markets live right there And there's also a complete redesign of the Rari portal that utilizes asset based discovery and streamlines the user experience So you can see here You can go to Rari dot app and you can select between if the etherium network and the arbitram network Which I find to be really really cool because I always love seeing that drop-down menu there So this is this is really awesome. I mean Rari dot app is actually a pretty cool URL as well like short and sweet But um, yeah, if you haven't tried this out yet definitely recommend doing so It's just another thing for you guys to do on the arbitram network super exciting deciding How fast all this stuff is coming together? I mean just a few weeks ago even a few months ago There wasn't really much to do now. There's plenty to do I mean there's new things to do pretty much like every week on the arbitram network on the optimism Network on the other kind of like networks as well like polygon on Stark nets coming, you know coming along very nicely I mentioned swag as swag misses are starting that round up yesterday Which lists a bunch of things so much happening guys, like I can't get up with it all these days actually You know, I find myself because Twitter's really bad doesn't show me a lot of things I think it's because like I wake up much later than I like basically at the end of people's days So Twitter basically doesn't adjust to that didn't show me a lot of things So I find myself going on anti-pro synthesis Twitter account a lot because he retweets basically everything like it's absolutely awesome How much he's able to cover and I use him as kind of like a curation resource as well So if you're not following him definitely do so because he's got a lot of great info there, but just scrolling through his feed It's just crazy how much is happening and this is just a theorem, right? This isn't just you know, the other kind of like changes isn't the other wider crypto ecosystem This is literally just a theorem and the fact that like I'm you know struggling to get up with it these days is really bullish and goes back to what I was saying at the start of the of the refuel About how who cares about the price guys like there's so much happening so much to pay attention to so much to learn so much To research the price is going to do what it's going to do But as long as we keep building as long as we keep adding value to the network It's just going to be up only over time. I believe All right, a quick little update here from optimism So as optimum as I've mentioned to you guys before with these roll-ups the more transactions that they process the cheaper the gas costs get over time because they kind of like amortize over all the transactions and you can actually see the perfect chart here of transactions divided by day times average time at the average times cheaper per transaction You can see as more transactions are coming in the gas savings go up with it So this is really really cool to see this in action here a lot of transactions happening on these these roll-ups lately I think they're gonna keep going up obviously over time. They're not even anywhere near their you know, their full capacity Which is crazy right like but I feel like you know, as I've said before What once they do tokens once they incentivize usage? We're probably gonna see a lot of this, you know a lot more transactions happening on these networks and actually funny thing about the tokens You know, I've been saying for a while that I figured a lot of these networks would do tokens in the first half of this year, you know, I still think some of them will but it's funny because Teams don't want to launch tokens into bear markets I don't think I think a lot of teams want to launch tokens when the market is hot and for obvious reasons But funny enough I actually think it's better for teams to launch tokens into bear markets because then the tokens price and token valuation Doesn't get ahead of itself It allows more people to buy it when it's in kind of like I guess like a lower valuation And allows more people to share in the upside so I would actually encourage Any team launching a token to do it during bearish periods? Because you get like that that you get like a better token distribution You get a better community because you get people that don't get rekt like I I don't know about you guys But like I kind of like take notice of these things and I actually sometimes actively look look out for it Whenever there's a really hyped token launch and do I do actually the perfect example here? Remember how high do I do X was and everyone was talking about it? Everyone was buying it and I remember saying in the discord channel I wasn't giving investment advice But I was saying the fully diluted value of do IDX went up to something like 25 30 billion and it's circulating Valuation was like 5% of that and I remember saying that that was ridiculous. It was absolutely ridiculous There's no way I was gonna hold that valuation when you know, the investors were up massively There was a quiddity mining going on there was a drops and stuff happening to There was just so much cell pressure and its valuation was just like really really high even though I had a lot of usage Its valuation was just too high for my blood and I think it's what trading at like six or seven dollars right now at its Peak it was trading at like $25 but but for every now and again I go on to like and check the replies to do IDX is Twitter posts or and Tonya from do IDX is Twitter post and there's lots of people in there saying do something to make the token price go up because What happened is they bought into the hype they bought in a really high valuation and then the token price just went down only since Then it's it's gotten pretty destroyed. I think it's down like 70% or something and this has happened to so many tokens It's happened a lot in the salon ecosystem I know it's become a meme at this point but in that ecosystem there's been so many tokens that people have gotten wrecked on and It's largely a function of these tokens having really small circulating supplies on their launch But also they launched during a bull market where the valuation gets way ahead of itself so I think launching in a bear markets actually really healthy and keeping their valuation as low as possible to get enough people kind of Like bought into it so they can share in the upside as a network grows is the way to go about it So I'm curious to see how many? L2 projects launched their tokens In this in the first half now of this year, they may wait until kind of like there's a more bullish market But we'll see we'll see I'm sure there'll be a couple of them that launched their tokens in the first half of this year still So another tweet here from swag nimis who was quote tweeting our Scott Lewis who said I think What my I think main tenets gone off? But anyway, I think that Scott Lewis said I think the dusting many people many people may net eat is a big deal What if by hard fork we Merkel drop every address on main net? If you're in with your point zero one two to ten eighth a free deposit to arbitrary optimism good to bootstrap optimistic wraps and good to stop People from getting hurt as fees rise so basically what Scott suggesting here is There's a lot of people that have stuck funds on a theory of main net because of the fact that you can't move it because it Costs more in gas fees to move it. So why not give these people the equivalents I guess like Of a free deposit into arbitrary optimism through a hard fork to just get them on board of there So they don't have stuck stuck funds and swag The most basically has a list about why this would be really cool and why he wants this so bad A few of the reasons biggest it would be the biggest a drop in crypto history gigantic media coverage massive awareness for roll-ups users get their stock funds back Raising the mood of outpriced users gain back dominance versus other EVM chains So I actually agree with basically all of this. I think this would be very very positive for the ecosystem I also think there'd be some controversy here as well because by Depositing by only giving a free deposit to arbitrary optimism. The Ethereum network is now paying playing favorites, right? The Ethereum community is now playing favorites. I'll have a term an optimism are not the only roll-ups in town Optimistic roll-ups in town. They're also not there only roll-ups in town So if we favor these two networks of all the other l2s or just one of them over all the other l2s Is that fair? I would argue, you know, I would argue that that is actually the deal breaker So if we're going to do this, which to be honest, I don't think this is this would happen That's it's so much kind of like work to get this done. I don't think it's gonna happen anytime soon but if it was to happen you would need to basically say users can onboard to any roll-up that they want out of a selection of Probably the most used roll-ups or at least the ones that have some sort of traction on a theorem You'd still be playing favorites to an extent because you might be excluding some roll-ups that are just getting off the ground or you know Just kind of like I'm getting a little bit of traction But it's still better than playing favorites with one or two of these things But I agree with everything else from spike to miss y'all good good thing to think about as I said don't think it's gonna happen Anytime soon, but if it does it would save a lot of users funds, which I'm all for of course, obviously So connects announced today or they introduced today the modular interoperability stack Which is which they're calling a paradigm shift for cross-chain operations featuring this nomad project here So what this is is connects has established a strategic partnership with nomad a new protocol that allows for cheap fully generalized Cross-chain communication that can easily be deployed to any chain or l2 that supports user-defined computation So nomad is an implementation an extension of the optics protocol, which is optimistic interchange communication So basically a different way to do cross-chain communication a I guess like this They're advertising it as a more secure way to do cross-chain communication faster and more liquid I believe as well. So There's a obviously a blog post you can read and a Twitter thread you can read on this as well But really cool to see I guess like connect which is one of the front runners or the forerunners of of cross-chain communication and cross l2 communication and I'm bridging to be teaming up with another project to kind of like take this to the next level as I've said to you guys Before I think bridging cross-chain communication cross l2 communication is going to be absolutely massive it's going to be one of the biggest kind of like Verticals within crypto and I think there's a lot of value to be had here because at the end of the day people want to Use networks where they can make money on especially if those networks alpha them cheap fees as well and people are gonna be bridging between networks because it's always gonna be some kind Of like somewhere to make money right whether it's on a theorem main net whether it's on another chain whether it's on a side channel L2 there's always going to be somewhere where you can be making money and Bridging between these chains needs to be seamless for enough people to kind of like take advantage of these opportunities So I think the demand for bridging is only going to go up and I'm really excited to see connects and nomad partner up here So Vitalik posted a new kind of I guess like research post today, and I can't load it because my Internet's gone off I still don't have proper internet guys by the way. They've just like screwed me around something something amazing I mean, I'm getting it hopefully next Tuesday, which will be six weeks from when I ordered it So it's just crazy, but so I've been using my phone's hotspot, which is as you can see totally unreliable But anyway, I want to go into just into detail quickly about this document this document is basically How to move forward with aetherium to single slot finality on the beacon chain So you can give this a rate highly recommended. It's really great. It's not too technical I think it's pretty easy for for everyone to follow but essentially right now on the beacon chain We don't have single slot finality. We have finality every 15 minutes or so now while we want single slot finality Well, there's a few different reasons of a title links them in the blog post I won't go into detail about them But there's some stuff around user experience and me V that you should kind of like check out there But I guess I just wanted to kind of like mention as well This probably is not gonna happen for three years, but did you know at the earliest or something like that? This is definitely something that comes after sharding comes up after vocal tries comes after a lot of other kind of like upgrades that are coming to The I guess like a theorem network post merge, so don't expect it anytime soon But I think that moving towards single slot finality if we can getting it down from 15 minutes to 16 seconds Would be an absolutely massive feat and absolutely massive improvement for the network And I'm very much looking forward to seeing the day that goes live I just wanted to kind of highlight this post for you guys to go give a read So it said from zapify shared this video today a sneak peek of the new NFT dashboard on zappa so you can see here as an activity dashboard now They've they've used me as an example so double-clicking to me here, and you can see kind of like my profile So this is basically a profile view, but you can kind of like this isn't just kind of like the NFT features Also the profile view where you can kind of follow people and see all their profiles and things like that so you can see here People following me who I'm following and you can go follow people from there And this is just a sneak peek and this kind of like NFTs that I've kind of like bought and hold and stuff like that So really really cool to see this I like this being able to kind of like explore your friends kind of like profile see stuff I mean as I've said to you guys before really there's only a few ways a good way to look at your NFTs right now I know there's a few different tools out there, but really there's um There's really just open see was what I use most of the time, but I hate having to change between different dashboards I would like to have everything in kind of like one dashboard and what better one what better dashboard for that for that to be Than Zappa so very cool to see these features being put together by Jasper by the way Jasper Shout out to you. I you've been doing me a bunch as well about these features So thank you for that, but yeah very very cool to see this you can go watch the video for a closer Look it'll be linked in the YouTube description, but I think that's gonna be it for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give the video a thumbs up Subscribe to newsletter join the disco channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow Thanks, everyone

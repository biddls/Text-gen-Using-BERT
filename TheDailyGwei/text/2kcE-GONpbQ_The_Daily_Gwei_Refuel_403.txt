 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily grey refuel where we kept the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host dennis asano on tays 11th of july 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So I hope you all had a great weekend I personally spent some time away from uh, I guess like crypto generally in crypto twitter generally over the weekend It was weird actually for the last two to three days. I spent most of it not doing crypto stuff I still kind of like paid attention here and there still was on twitter a little bit But again, I kind of like came back to it tonight to get ready for the refuel and I was like, wow, okay a lot happened while I was kind of like offline here that I kind of like didn't really uh, Get to see because I was just kind of like spending more time offline So that was different something different I guess like probably best to do that sort of stuff in a bear market where You know, there are still things you're going to miss but it's not like a bull market where you have to kind of like Be online because you're getting fomo right and you're going crazy and being like, oh my god I need to know what's happening blah blah, right? So I spent a bit of time just playing some games I played uh games called little nightmares one and two. It's kind of like a puzzle platformer game, uh, two of them They're not that long, but they were pretty enjoyable. I really really liked it I like that style of game and I built my friend a new pc So definitely stuff that was still on a computer like around computers, but definitely not really crypto related So that was kind of like refreshing there. But anyway now i'm back into it I'm very excited to go through the updates from the weekend today So let's get started with tim biker's first update here, which was a recap of the all core devs call that happened Friday night now This was not the one where they discussed the girly testnet, uh data that will be in two weeks time on july 21st And I kind of like talked about that on last week's refills So when that call all core devs call happens, we'll get a girly date And then after that, we'll obviously get main net date for the for the merge, but i've been through all that already So no need for me to rehash that here But if you do want to read tim's kind of like recap thread of what happened on friday's call You can it'll be linked in the youtube description below I think what they really discussed was gray glacier, which was obviously the fork to push back the difficulty bomb and then the Sepolia testnet merge that also happens I went kind of like smoothly as I discussed last week And then a few other kind of like things here and there but I as I said, I don't think they talked about Girly, uh, actually, uh, we felt like we may be able to pick the okay. So they okay So they okay, there's a there's an actual update here on girly. Are they saying we felt like we may be able to pick the Ttd for girly either next week during the consensus layer call or the week after during all core devs Okay, so it's either going to happen on the consensus layer call which is which is a separate call to the all core devs Call which will happen next week Uh, well next week actually being this week or the all core devs call which I think is next thursday So one of the two will get a ttd for girly which will obviously dictate the date I'm, still expecting early to mid august for for girly. Um, maybe if it happens this week that the ttd or the date It'll be early august Um, if it kind of like happens next week Maybe it'll be mid august and it could even could even be like really early august or like the last day of july or something It just depends on on how much time that they want to give. Um, they want to give people and they want to give uh, uh kind of like Developers and everything like that to get get their stuff ready and things like that Uh, but also, you know, if it does happen earlier and everything goes well on girly and we don't have any major issues Or any merge related issues and it pretty much goes how sepolia went like even as I mentioned last week Even though the sepolia merge had those issues with the configuration stuff Like I don't think that's a main net showstopper at all. I think that we should just keep still pushing forward on that Because once the issues were rectified we went back up to like very high participation rates. It wasn't really a big issue there So I think that that'd be fine So if we do get like a maybe a really early august, uh, kind of like girly, um, ttd At ttd time or even just like early august generally then we could still see the merge in mid-september, right? Like I I know last week I said that I think it'd be more likely to be late september But it just it depends on the girly date Like I think if girly goes through early august then, you know, six weeks from girly to uh mid Sorry to main net which is bringing us to about mid-september. So that would probably be plenty of time I think I don't think you need more than six weeks. I mean two like eight well That's that's a month and a half you do eight weeks that that ends up being two months of basically Nothing happening. Uh, there could be I mean not nothing happening There'll be shadow forks between girly and main net but really, you know, I don't think we need that long So it could still happen in mid-september But I mean at this stage at this rate, I feel like september is pretty much a lock-in Um, probably not early isn't it but like mid to late september is pretty much a lock-in i'd put money on it at this stage Uh, but obviously depends how girly goes. I don't expect there to be any issues with it since we haven't had any I mean like merge related issues since we haven't had any merge related issues on things like shadow forks on Supolia on robston, uh, it was all either non-merge related or just config, uh kind of like related stuff there So definitely looking forward to seeing when the ttd gets announced for girly as I said either on this week consensus layer call Which I believe is maybe later in the week. I actually don't know what date that call is Um or next thursday, which is the all core dev school. So we'll have to see how that goes But yeah, you can read this whole thread from tim for a full breakdown of friday's all core dev school I'll link it in the youtube description All right So last week I think last friday or thursday's refill I was gushing a lot about DeFi and talking about how it's such a step up from what we're kind of like used to within the c5 Traditional finance systems and all the reasons surrounding that so i'm not going to rehash that here But andrew keys actually put out a really interesting tweet over the weekend where he said the fact that celsius is paying back Ave compound and maker before humans should explain smart contracts to humanity And then there's a there's a follow-up comment here from louis who says smart contracts are tough Negotiators and then andrew says there is no negotiation Which is really cool. So there are like I want to kind of like talk about this a little bit But there are a couple of differences here. So the reason why celsius is paying back avian compound and maker Um, well, I mean there's a few reasons but the one reason is like it's kind of like over collateralized, right? For them to borrow from these platforms. They had to put up collateral for it. There was no way about it The protocol would not give them any money unless they put collateral up for it, right? So they had to put collateral there now on the on the flip side The protocol is not going to give them their collateral back until they pay their debt And yes, some people can say okay Well, what what what if the kind of like token holders got together? In some of these systems like ivy or compound and maker that have on-chain governance and said well We'll just give the funds back to celsius without them paying back their their money Why would they do that? Like there's no incentive for them to do that at all and to get any to get that through would be And you have to kind of like convince not just like one person or one company you have to convince a lot of people It just wouldn't happen. So technically well, technically these sort of things can happen It just wouldn't and some of these protocols don't allow it to happen even technically, right? So because of that celsius knows this i'm like wow, okay The only way we're getting a collateral out of this system is if we pay down our debts So they're prioritizing paying down their debts with defi, uh over their debts with humans because they know with humans Obviously humans can go down the the route of kind of like suing celsius or Or bringing them to court uh criminal court or anything like that over what they've done and try to get the money out of them But at the end of the day like there's no way for them to kind of like force them to do it They have to go through third parties. Whereas with defi there's no need for all of that These protocols are just basically not even saying anything celsius. They don't know who celsius is The protocol doesn't know that celsius is this kind of like This centralized platform that is having a lot of trouble all the protocol knows is that this address put collateral into Into the protocol that borrowed funds against it and then by per the rules of the protocol This address needs to pay back that collateral that that that kind of like debt actually doesn't have to be that address You can actually have other ones paying back the debt But the debt just needs to be paid back and then the address that originally put the collateral link can take the collateral out And if they pay all the debt off they can take all their collateral back. That's it. No negotiations No people in the mix of this nothing. It's it's kind of like between celsius and the protocol Another said to to the protocol celsius is just another user. It doesn't matter who it is Like the protocol doesn't differentiate because of the fact the protocol is running on code that doesn't care about anything else except I guess like the collateral factors and things like that depending on the protocol. It's it's a bit different there So that's why there is no negotiation yet because there is no one to negotiate with as I said You could go to the governors of these protocols and say hey like save us bail us out But that's just not going to happen right for for a number of different reasons just not going to happen But some of these protocols don't even have the option of doing that I mean, I I think I'm not sure about these ones specifically, but I think a lot of them don't really have that option because We just imbalanced the system and uh by doing so we just just destroy the project altogether Like you could imagine a thing where there's this massive whale who doesn't pay back any of their debt and then for some reason The token holders come together of the protocol and say okay We're going to give this whale back their uh, the collateral without them paying back the debt Well that just leaves a massive hole in the system that needs to be paid back anyway And then across all users, right? So when you kind of like look at it like that It just becomes a basically near zero chance for the system to pay back their debt So it's basically near zero chance of something like that happening Um, even if it is technically possible to happen So this again is another reason why defi has such a massive leg up over Tradfi and cify but there are some drawbacks here. Obviously the drawback is is that this own? This is only kind of like possible because of that over collateralization or just the colorization aspect anyway For let's let's use a real world example here if you wanted to buy a house you take out a mortgage a home loan Yeah, you have to borrow money from a bank usually or you know some other financial institution usually a bank For and to do that You're not collateralizing it with anything most like especially if kind of like you don't have an existing house You're not collateralizing with equity if you're a first home buyer You just want a home loan, but you're collateralizing it with is your reputation who you are your identity? Obviously, you can't do that on chain right now There are solutions that are going to be coming for that But it's not an over collateralized or even really a collateralized kind of loan what it is is basically you're putting a small deposit down And then you're taking the rest out as kind of small deposit on the house and which I mean It is not really kind of like collateral right and then you're taking a loan and then you're buying the house and then the house Becomes the collateral that backs. That's uh that loan that you've taken out but through that process like there's humans all the way There's middlemen everywhere. There's there's laws and regulations and everything in there and it gets it gets very murky Like the bank has to go through the legal system to take your house from from you right as collateral If if you fail to kind of like pay the mortgage back So it's it's different in that sense. Is that like you don't have to over collateralize for a home loan, for example Whereas within defi I don't think any protocol except maybe something like a maple finance and a gold finch I think there's only two or three of them and they're not real they don't really work the same way as avant compound and maker Do that will let you borrow without putting up, you know a collateral and especially like you have to over collateralize as well And you have to over collateralize usually by a lot So the capital efficiency just isn't really there compared to the traditional system But you do get all those other benefits, of course now hopefully in the future when we have more of these solutions online like decentralized identity and we have ways to Lend capital outs to you know, just people Based on their reputation and we can have relative certainty that they'll pay it back or if they don't pay it back There's a way to kind of like claw back that those funds we'll see how that plays out But I think the fact that these things have to be over Cleralized before people can kind of like borrow from them That is the most powerful thing here and that obviously is not scalable to the world. It is not a credit system It like it doesn't really give anyone any kind of like credit or anything like that So what they do give is just the ability to collateralize and borrow against it like a leverage position essentially So leverage your existing assets to borrow against it Whereas the the kind of the definition of credit is is usually that you're given it based on like I don't know a credit score which is based on your identity and reputation right rather than based on something Like as a collateral but obviously in the case of a home loan the house becomes the collateral that backs it up But as I said, it's a different situation It's not the same situation as having to put up the collateral first before you can borrow anything in this instance You borrow something you buy something with it and then that becomes the collateral, right? So it's basically like a leverage position Just with uh with the fact that you don't have to put up collateral first to do it You just the bank will just give you the money based on I guess obviously like your your um kind of like credit score and your Employment status and kind of like things like that and and and the rate will kind of like depend on various factors, too so Uh, yeah, I mean that's kind of like the differences there now. Hopefully I did a good explanation I had I um I explained that correctly and properly uh because it is kind of like getting into a bit of a murky territory there Uh with kind of like complexities between the two, but I thought this tweet was good from andrew here I kind of like just explained it very well I think in terms of the fact that celsius is just forced to pay this back like there's no negotiations here Whereas with their human counterparts who they owe money to they can basically just put their lawyers in front of them and be like Talk to our lawyers Uh, you know, you'll get your money when you get your money and they just keep delaying delaying delaying Whereas with defy with these protocols the lawyers can't do shit like no one can do shit It's it's like the protocols are telling celsius essentially you pay back your debt or we're not giving you your collateral back Let's see it. There's no there's no negotiation, right? Which I think is pretty cool But anyway moving on from that I think I spent a bit too long on that one there um, so an interesting tweet from pollina that I think maybe a lot of people will disagree with but basically pollina said Uh, he they quote by saying roll ups pay most of their transaction fees to l1 and roll ups are bearish for for l1 Are both false application layer accrues most value Execution layer some value l1 token has money used across execution and app layers accrue some data availability layer very little And then they continue with kind of like some follow-up tweets here Um, but also, uh, I think uh pollina said application layer not application token accrues the value. So some people got confused over that Anyway, I want to spend a few minutes here breaking this down So application layer accruing the value not the token itself means that kind of like obviously the applications accruing value in terms of like tvl for example or Users or or fear for you to them doesn't mean it accrues to the token But it still accrues to the application itself, right? There is value there like we've seen that obviously tbl is a very popular metric If not, you know, very flawed still very popular And it's used by a variety of people the execution layers within the ethereum context are layer twos, right? That's our optimism arbitrum Uh, uh, you know the zkvm stuff like that. They're kind of like the execution layers, uh ethereum layer one He's technically an execution layer as well But long term we expect it to just be the settlement land for all these other execution layers Of course through the modular roadmap and then pollina says, you know l1 token as money used across execution and app layers accrues some value so I actually think That this that's the sum value here should be like most value. I actually think that l1 tokens generally Most of them if not all of them I pretty much think all of them will accrue only accrue value long term if they both become a money and a store of value now There's a lot of different things that feed into that and a lot of different things that can make something a money or a store Of value just because something is used for payments doesn't really make it something that's going to accrue value. Yes. Okay It's a money but there's a difference between kind of like money as a kind of like a payments thing and money nests and kind of like Uh something like the the us dollar right the us dollar doesn't gain value over time It loses value against a lot of other things over time But it is the best money in the world Like it it loses less value than all the other fiat currencies, especially in times like like now where it's rallying against others Uh because of kind of like global macro, uh consequences So there's different kind of like definitions and different kind of like views there and there's a store of value thing Which is pretty self-explanatory, right? You you hold it. Basically. You don't have to do anything with it You just hold it and you think and and believe that this asset will either appreciate over time or hold its value over time Against some other currency against some other thing usually fiat currencies So for example people say, you know gold is a good store of value because it both appreciates and holds its value And holds a stable value over time against the us dollar and then people say well gold hasn't really Increased in value for a long time now and that's true But it still can be considered a decent store of value because it hasn't lost Uh, its value relative to the us dollar as much as other things, right? Um, so it kind of like holds its uh, sorry It hasn't kind of like um, uh, yeah. No. No, I think I said that right and and it kind of like holds its value there So it's all about purchasing power as i've discussed before and how different things hold value against each other So that could be you know Something that becomes a story value and I think the only two stores of value really in crypto right now are btc and eath I think btc is a weak store of value to be honest I actually think its narrative around store value is is dying. Um, and i've discussed this before so I won't rehash it here Um, I think eath is a very very powerful money within the crypto ecosystem right now Uh, it's used as obviously as a money within the nft ecosystem It's used um, it's monetary properties gives it very good collateral properties and that's used within defi. It's obviously used as a Like kind of like money as uh, I guess like a money bond Sov hybrid with staking right and then obviously we have 1559 burning it as well Which kind of like adds to its deflationary properties which adds to its low value properties as well So those all come together to I think accrue most of the value to To the layer one token and and and for ethereum it's obviously very very strong and then polina's last point here about data availability Recruing occurring very little um, very little value now I think the reason that this is actually true and I agree with this is because of the fact that Data availability or data layers that they're going to be very very abundant, right? They're going to grow faster than everything else. They're going to go faster than execution layers They're going to grow faster than sentiment layers. They're going to grow faster than everything simply because data Is abundant hard drive solos they drop like all that that kind of like space is abundant But at the same time it's more about kind of like where those data availability layers are like for example ethereum with Dank sharding that's an ethereum data availability layer, but then you have polygonal veil you have celestia you have data layer There's a kind of like standalone Data availability layers, but still they're not going to be able to accrue that much value because they they growth in terms of capacity Is probably going to end up outpacing the demand at least for the foreseeable future And if not just for the foreseeable future, maybe indefinitely we don't know yet and there are disagreements here between people i've spoken to about this But still like a standalone data availability layer logically really shouldn't accrue that much value to its native token Because of the fact that there's just there's so much space abundant the fear of when you would be very very low The kind of like the the token itself would not really take on any monetary money nest properties or sov properties because the the layer is Not being used as a kind of like a settlement layer It's not being used as as kind of like an execution layer or anything like that It's being used purely for data. So this is just a pure data layers Whereas ethereum layer one is kind of like going to be a hybrid where it's got a data availability layer But it also acts as a very very strong settlement layer with the native token eth being used in staking for all that Kind of like settlement security and things like that as well. So that plays into into that there and I actually Replied to poina, you know, I said I don't think people understand that most of the value comes from moneyness uses sov Fear of a new on the l1 is an added bonus now Obviously i've been very very bullish and still remain bullish on eip1559 and burning of eth But if that existed in a vacuum if if eth didn't have monetary properties if he didn't have sov if none of that if eth Was just being burnt and that's all we had to drive value to eth Eth would be worth way less than what it is today just based on that. So when you kind of like look at it that way I think it's just a it's a bonus at a very very good bonus very very strong bonus, especially over the long term But it is not the main thing that drives value to l1 tokens. I truly believe the main thing Is that moneyness and store of value which comes from a lot of the utility built around these things people say? Oh story value doesn't have to have utility. It's like no it doesn't have to but it's better than it does right? It adds more value to the actual thing that adds more value to the asset So why not give it as much utility as possible and I can't think of any other asset in crypto That has as much utility as eth does there is none. I don't believe there is any I don't believe there is any that even come close to each size in terms of liquidity And market cap and all that sorts of stuff. So taking all that together. I do agree with poigna that's uh, well, I mean I think it's like a half agree I Kind of like I would say that the l1 token accrues most most of the value not just some But I do agree with the kind of like broader points here and I think that people often get the wrong idea about these sorts of things Because they're not really used to thinking in money Terial money nests and store value terms and then they're kind of like Probably definition of store value is probably not the right one It's probably come from like the bitcoin a camp which and I don't think there is any like right Way to think about it But the way I simply think about it is okay I mean we're holding this asset with a belief That it is it is going to kind of like protect their capital and not just protect their capital in terms of Be able to make them more money and and appreciate over time but also just be able to not lose them purchasing power because obviously Over the last two years I guess or one to two years there's been high inflation in fiat currencies Which means purchasing power is going down for these things so you obviously don't want to be holding cash for too long But where else do you go like right now? It's actually quite hard like you don't want to be holding cash for too long because there's a lot of inflation But also risk on assets, which is pretty much everything I like pretty much all assets at this point are going down right so you don't want to be in them either So cash is like the least worst position to be right now, but that's going to change eventually It's not always going to be like that So if you're playing defensively you're thinking okay, where do I park my capital a lot of people are parking in eith? You know there are still obviously people parking in a btc some people are parking yet In other kind of like cryptos people still buying stocks, you know for every sellover as a buyer guys Like it's not like any of these people are buying it. It's not like you know For every sellover as a buyer guys like it's not like any of these stuff goes to zero. It's not luna I mean, you know luna went to zero but like You know the most of it doesn't actually go to zero so from that perspective, I think that That drives most of the value to the l1 tokens and that's why btc and ether so far ahead of every other l1 token Because of the fact that those the moneyness and sov properties are so powerful And as I said, I think btc is actually losing those properties over time. I think eith is gaining more of those properties So that's why it's the number one of the top reasons why I expect the flippening to happen eventually because I don't see a path Where btc continues to grow its moneyness and sov? Whereas I very clearly see the path for eith, especially with the merge approaching that's a huge catalyst obviously, right? But the merge in a vacuum as well doesn't really do anything it exists alongside everything else within ethereum that drives the value here But anyway, i'm gonna leave that at that. Wow. I'm already at 23 minutes I'm gonna get through the rest of these so Uh superfizz, uh put out a tweet where he said you think staking is hard It's not you could lose all of your eith you won't you need powerful hardware. You don't it requires constant maintenance It doesn't only professionals should do it. This is flat wrong Staking on ethereum is meant for home users We didn't spend so long Developing a bleeding edge proof of stake protocol and probably the most decentralized proof of stake protocol in the ecosystem To let it be dominated by professionals and not cater to home users. It was literally built around catering to home users That's why the other the kind of like, um beacon chain is able to handle so many validators Obviously the 32 week requirement is not something that I guess like is accessible to a lot of people even at today's prices But there is a lot of other accessible ways to stake especially with things like rocker pool and other such services Um, but in terms of like the hardware and the software and just running it It's it's relatively straightforward The biggest barrier to entry is probably that 32th requirement if you wanted to be a solo staker Now there is actually a kind of like difference here between home stakers and solo stakers You can be a home staker without being a solo staker because you can stake with something like rocker pool So you don't have to have your 30th or whatever you can go stake with rocker pool and still run the software And still run the nodes on your own hardware. Um, so There are kind of like ways around and there will be more in the future hopefully as well But yeah, I thought this was a just a great tweet from super fears and you also linked to a bunch of different kind of like links Very like lots of good resources here if you're interested in staking on your own especially whether at home Or at home as a solo staker. You should definitely check all of this out I'll link it in the youtube description for you to do so Um, all right next thing just here from super fears as well was kind of like just some dates around the merge Stuff, obviously everyone asking when merge robston merged june 8th. Sepolia merged july 6th Both mergers were successful but had some human introduced config issues that were solved quickly Girlie isn't scheduled but may be scheduled during the july 14 call. There's the date That's the consensus layer call date. So july 14 mainnet merge will follow shortly after girly. All right So let's let's kind of like since we're since we've got a date now July 14 girly ttd date gets announced. Let's let's say that happens, right? It gets announced for early august because I mean Yeah, early august right all goes smoothly. Well, then I think mid Mid to late september is locked in 100 at that point. Um, if all goes smoothly on girly anyway I'm, not going to keep speculating that I did talk about this just before but that's the that's the call to look out for If it doesn't get discussed on that call then obviously it'll be on the next thursday's all core dev score then definitely it'll Probably be later september then but we'll have to see have to see how this goes All right, so this there was this interesting uh kind of like table here from this account on twitter res And they said it's been a while since the last time I had a look at on-chain volume So basically the key takeaways from this table is that only eth or ethereum and bsc do 50 plus million dollars in volume Wales prefer to use arbitrum instead of optimism both clearly clearly ahead of metis harmony moonbeam and Evm os seem dead Not all evm chains are created equal guys. Like these are all evm chains here Not all of them are created equal most of them are literal like useless trash. Like i'm just gonna not sugarcoat here Ethereum obviously the most dominant bsc has surprised a lot of people i've gone over this before has a very strong presence in asia Polygon third shouldn't really surprise anyone here arbitrum and optimism in fourth and fifth place there and then avalanche Chronos phantom, I guess like Trailing closely behind but phantom everyone talked about that last year. It's pretty much dead now, uh chronos I don't hear anyone talking about this. Uh, again, I kind of like um, I I don't think that's kind of like long-lasting Avalanche has lost a lot of steam right? It's already been overtaken by layer twos on ethereum Even the layer twos came later arbitrum doesn't even have a token yet Optimism obviously has a token but hasn't really used it yet and then there's a second layer two So I don't think that's gonna be used yet. And you can see like number of transactions not just volume as well. So arbitrum Sorry, uh optimism has the same amount of kind of like transactions as as avalanche Arbitrum has less but I think uh that whales prefer to use Arbitrum as as kind of like rez says here and then average transactions in dollars You can see uh, like kind of like what people prefer to use and what I find hilarious about this is that Avalanche was kind of like going on about the fact that we got super cheap fees And we got like a lot of people with like hardly any money or blah blah blah I mean the the average transaction on avalanche in dollars is three hundred and seventy seven dollars like that is Like I mean, it's not huge but like I think when kind of looking at looking at these sorts of things Yes, it's good to have really really cheap fees. But uh, like if you're just an evm chain It's not really going to do anything because the the la two evm chains are going to just obliterate these things Like I'm very very bearish on the c chain on avalanche and the subnets just don't make any sense to me like a theorem And l2 is just going to absolutely destroy them and they're already pretty much has right and all these other ones like they're just all Garbage like why do they like I don't want to bash them too much here But like that doesn't make any sense that these things exist especially like if they're a layer two on ethereum even Even a layer two on ethereum if like there aren't going to be that many successful ones It's going to be a handful of them So like when you look at it like that, it just boggles the mind that so many of these things Uh kind of like are still around they're still kicking in and people still they're still supporters But then when you really dive deep into it, you can kind of like guess why it's because of the tokens, right? Anyway, I don't want to spend too long bashing there. But I thought this was an interesting table to just kind of like look at All right. So another interesting set of stats here is from michael who uh works at uh optimism labs here So this is basically a dune analytics dashboard that kind of shows a bunch of optimism Uh related transaction fees and I think i've gone through this one before on the refuel but just like if you really are interested in looking at how Optimism is handling fees at both l2 and l1 this dashboard is for you I'll link in the youtube description below and you can go check that out All right, so pseudo amm is now live So pseudo amm is a new marketplace protocol that changes the way we think about nft liquidity and trading it is highly flexible gas efficient and fully on chain so another Nft marketplace another decentralized nft marketplace and it is on chain So starting from when it went live users can create pools that gradually buy or sell nfts along price curves Provide liquidity to pools that buy and sell nfts to earn fees directly list nfts at fixed prices Lps also have pool control over their pools pricing and can adjust at any time. So basically It's an nft Uh trading protocol that does things a bit differently. It's not like your open sea or looks rare It is using a kind of like curve here to set the prices of our kind of like nfts and the capable bidding and and and And sorry buying and selling on these sorts of things with either a linear curve or exponential curve You can see in this screenshot all the options that you have here to I guess like change the way we trade nfts I've been following this protocol for a little while now. Uh, it's been the kind of like works for a little while I think it's super interesting. I want to dive deeper into it. I didn't have a chance over the weekend To dive too deep into it, but you should definitely check it out and see what yeah you like about it What you don't like about it and also join the discord if you're interested in it I think it's really cool that we're seeing more experiments within the nft marketplace ecosystem because i'm sick of seeing the same thing just forked and over and over and everything like that like it's fine But at the same time I would love to see more experimentation As I normally do in these in these kind of like things so great to see that this is live You can go check it out. I'll link it in the description All right, so the protocol guild has a proposal to the nouns dal community They'll be going live in two days for voting So if you are part of nouns and you want to well guess like nouns dal or kind of like the nouns Ecosystem you can go and vote on this in I think two days from today. Yeah two days from today So this is the protocol for sorry This is a proposal for nouns dal to send funds to protocol guild and i've talked about the protocol guild on the refill before So I won't rehash that here But you can read the proposal here if you want i'll link in the youtube description below. It's basically Wanting to raise I guess how much do they want to raise? Yeah, they want to get 500 eith This is not a raise. I want to get like a 500 eith donation, which is two percent of the nouns dal treasury Into protocol guild here. I think this shouldn't be contentious or shouldn't be something that's hard to get through i'm pretty much Thinking that this is going to go through without any fanfare like I feel like Nouns dal are pretty much closely aligned with public goods. I've spoken to Someone from there actually a little while ago and I know a few of the nouns Kind of like whales and they're definitely like public goods maximalist and they're definitely all for this I think so. I think this should pass but yeah, really really cool to see that.

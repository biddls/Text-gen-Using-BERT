 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the dailygue review where we cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host danthessa sana and it is the 30th of may 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it So I just wanted to talk through something that I kind of saw over the weekend Which was kind of like a bear thesis for eth posted by uh, andrew kang who works at mechanism capital here a fund in the crypto space Now he's got kind of like a screenshot of a bunch of dot points here that he posted to twitter kind of giving his I guess bear case for eth and he he starts by saying eth has a major has a major flows imbalance now What I want to do is kind of run through each of these points and and kind of like Teach you guys how I go through these sorts of things and how I reason about it and how I can kind of really quickly Kind of like come up with the conclusion that it's basically fud. Um, and and you know, if funny enough He actually posted this kind of like at the bottom of of kind of like eight like the 1700 bottom that we just had Like I don't know if that's gonna gonna hold but he posted and then we started going up again So I was like, you know, this is hilarious that the timing here, but basically I want to go through each of these points So he what he what he kind of like means by a major flows imbalance here is he means that there's more people Well, he believes that there's a lot more people selling than buying and he's he kind of starts by saying, you know These are the people that kind of like a buying eth right now and he says Short-term scalpers because round numbers fading sentiment, etc. Aka the short-term traders, right? And then the second point is no one else because all other eth believers deployed their dip capital and previous 1000 dips Now look, he's literally just kind of like given two points with no data to back it up at all He's just like said things. So that's the first thing that that always kind of goes off my head. It's okay Well, anyone can say whatever they want, but is the actual data backing this up? Is there actually actually kind of like a thesis behind there? Is there actually kind of like any reasoning behind it at all? And really there isn't So we're kind of like when when he when he said this I was just like, okay This doesn't really make much sense. Like there's no data backing this up Like what are you even trying to say here and then then he goes on, you know Who are the people selling and this is even worse like he says? institutions that realize eighth market opportunity is below expectations and fundamentals are deteriorating such as network activity and fees and growth inverting Okay, so like when I see something like this I just I'm puzzled because if you baseline I guess like network activity across every single network right now You know encrypt or whether it be aetherium Bitcoin any other network out there And then you look at what the kind of market is in like we're in a bear market obviously and you baseline it to that Then obviously never activity is going to be down like the less people there in the ecosystem The less activity is going to be on chain the less fees a theorem is going to be generating as an example here And then that's kind of like what you know, what's going to happen, right? They're networks just going to kind of be used less and network activity goes down But you got a baseline it to the market they were in if a theorem is network activity was going down during a bull market Then I would say that Andrew has a point But it's not it's going down in line with general market sentiment general market activity So and then you know just the broader point of saying fundamentals deteriorating, but what do you mean like? What do you mean fundamentals deteriorate nothing has fundamentally changed for aetherium at all like the road map hasn't changed because the price went down The merge timeline hasn't of time maybe not timeline I thought about the merge in a bit, but like the merge hasn't changed like it's still happening, right? The layer two ecosystem still kind of like happening like like when I see these sorts of things that just get so puzzled I'm like what fundamentals are you talking about network activity and fees well? Yeah, they go down or up depending on what the market is doing like that's just what happens because these networks are economic financial networks Less new money coming in or I guess like less market activity less activity on the chain I don't know why this is hard for some people to kind of like get and then you know he says growth inverting I mean we had lots of growth and now we have a bear market, so let's baseline it Are we over the long term higher than what we were? We are right the growth is still there the network activity is still there Ethereum is still generating millions of dollars a day in kind of like fear of a new at layer one later Whose are still growing yeah, so I just don't think that's a point at all really And then he goes on to say other people selling include institutions that got wrecked by Luna and other assets need to reduce risk and all Getting net outflows from LP redemptions now if you don't know kind of like how the fund and VC kind of like world works He's got a point here But I think this is not really a point towards ethers is a point towards just like crypto in general so for example if There were funds where they were there were a fair few funds that got wrecked on Luna and got lost money on Luna or ust They may have LPS which are called limited partners basically people who invest in the in kind of like the fund Saying oh well I want to pull my money out now right and if that money is not in like a stablecoin Or is not in fiat well Then the fund has to sell off other assets And I think we saw we actually saw a bit of that that I think that's why it went to went to 1700 and why BTC went to it went down as well I think that we just saw you know broad selling from that, but the thing is is that like that's not a long-term thing That's a short-term thing and that for every cell is a buyer so these funds and whatever can be offloading But people are buying this up right so I and I don't think that's a permanent thing at all That's just going to be a short-term There's gonna be a medium-term things I think it's just gonna be a short-term thing And I and I would assume that a lot of them have already kind of like not maybe not finished selling But like a lot of them have sold the bulk of what they probably wanted to sell at this point But that point there, I think is the strongest one out of all of his points But at the same time it doesn't just apply to eat that applies to literally like every asset that these funds were kind of like Holding that they needed to sell off and in all honesty the funds They're probably gonna sell off the assets that they're least bullish on and they're probably gonna be least bullish on some of the other Like crap out there that we've seen fall so much and they're gonna sell that first rather than their eighth, right? And then his next point go Andrew says retail that sell because prices go down and they are bleeding in multiple directions I mean yes, but again this doesn't apply to just eat like retail if retail investors are panicking and just selling everything They're going to sell everything that they hold and a lot of them don't just hold eight they hold multiple Cryptos like including Bitcoin including a lot of the other tokens and stuff like that But you know even still on nets they're probably gonna sell BTC and eighth less than they're gonna sell their other assets just by virtue of the fact that beta C and ether going down Less like could you imagine someone holding an asset? That's down You know I guess like 50% in you know in a week or something versus 8 or BTC right like they're probably gonna sell off that Asset rather than that it depends on what they have conviction on and things like that But again, this is not unique to eat So I don't know how this can even be put on here as like an eighth kind of like bear case like that's a crypto Bear case right that's not an eighth bear case so again Just a weird point there, and then these last night last point He's got another point here where he said Project treasuries are selling because they realize their runways shrinking by the minute Hearing many projects have had poor run my playing and actually kept most proceeds in eighth Okay to a certain extent yes, but at the same time what project treasuries people will point out Oh, there's some NFT treasuries that raised in Ethan, and they need to sell to kind of like get runway like fair enough But that's nowhere near the amount of eight that was raised by something like icos right there is a major reason Why eighth went up in 2017 was icos a major reason why it went down in 2018 was? Ico's because the icos had these massive eighth treasuries that they kept selling during 2018 and that drove the price down The NFT treasuries in eighth they're nowhere near as big as what the icos were not it's only in the same league I don't even think it's worth comparing the two because it's just so different and on top of that in 2018 like there was a lot of arguments to be made that there was no reason to hold eighth like there was like you know Ethereum was dead the eighth wasn't gonna call any value and even like some of the biggest eighth balls But I believed like you know what's next faith sort of thing, so there's that to consider as well So even if these NFT treasuries are starting the eighth one They don't have anywhere near a man of the amount of eight that Ico treasuries had and two there's so many other So many more reasons to hold eighth than they were in 2018 so comparing the two I think is a bit bit weird Andrew didn't compare the two in east in his kind of like tweet here, but I've seen other people do it I just kind of like wanted to um wanted to kind of like Speak to that and then he says short sellers I mean, okay, but short sellers are selling everything again doesn't just apply to eighth and there's short-term speculators They're not long-term kind of like investors Miners yeah, okay fair enough But again same applies to something like Bitcoin and the thing is he actually inadvertently gave a bull case here that minor sell pressure Is disappearing in a very short period of time like in the next few months? It's gone completely forever Within aetherium, so I don't even think that that's a good bear case at all right and then lastly people that wanted to sell earlier But wanted a bounce again fair enough, but that like is not unique to Eve So when I this is kind of a car run through it. I'm just like is I asked two major questions I'm like is this unique to eighth and does this actually have any data backing it up Right and pretty much none of his points here are unique to eighth And none of them really have something to back it up besides. Maybe the institution signing off assets, but again That's not unique to eight so you know when I say stuff like this I just feel like people believe it at face value because it looks like it's been presented in in kind of like a logical way and kind of like You you you like when the price is going down you kind of like give more credit to bare feet To the bearish outlook not not maybe not you guys But like people in general just give more credit to the bear thesis because the price is going down which again He's just like a really weird thing that people do But just generally I just thought this was like pretty trash like for a bear thesis right like and I feel like he put this together Kind of because the price is going down. It was just like very very weird So that's kind of like how I run through it all I hope that was kind of like a bit educational for you Guys there on just like how I think through these things But it becomes second nature eventually and honestly like it's always good to test your own thesis test your own kind of like bold thesis Especially on things and it's fine to do that, but you need to test it with like reasoning You can't just test it with a few dot points And you know people just saying things like if you took what Andrew was saying here at face value and believed it without doing any Of your own research without reasoning about any of these points then okay for sure you would believe that that was like a really really bearish case for each, but I just went through and kind of like systematically Debunked each of these kind of like points You know I mean I could go into more detail, but I don't obviously don't have unlimited time But you know I just kind of like when I look at these sorts of things I just I can't help but laugh because it's like Where was this like when he was over 4,000 like why is it is it suddenly? I'm suddenly a bear case now and the most hilarious thing is still to me reading that like He one of his bear kind of like cases was that network activity and fees are down like of course They are bro like the market is quiet like I don't understand How this is like I don't even understand how he put that out there without Reasoning about it himself like it just puzzled me really really bad So I just wanted to kind of like go over that with you guys But anyway, I'm gonna move on to some some kind of like I guess more exciting news from the weekend and that was Stuff around the merge and particularly around merge timing and the difficulty bombs so you can read this sweet thread here from Tim biker Which goes to the all core devs call that happened on? Friday night here or I guess like Friday night for me Friday whatever for you for you guys, but basically the TLDR I'm not gonna read through the whole thread obviously the TLDR is that I Like the core devs is base have basically agreed to delay the difficulty bomb to August so from June to August now for those Of you who may not have been paying attention the difficulty bomb has already kicked in and I'll show you how you can how you Can find this I'm just gonna bring up the chart here I forgot to get it up before so the difficulty bombs kicked in which means block times have actually started going up already So if I bring this chart over here for you guys if I put it here You can see this is the average block time chart now those spikes They'll give you one guess what those spikes are in the chart you guessed it difficulty bomb right so we had this one here Which lasted a while back in 2017 block times went up to 30 seconds now normal block times back Then were about fourteen point five seconds today. They're normal block times at 13 seconds But that was kind of like a big spike there then again a big spike here right and then again other big spike here Well, I mean bigger than the normal case right of a spike here for the difficulty bomb there Then the difficulty bomb was delayed until kind of like basically today And now we can see that you know we have block times of around 13 point three seconds and now they're up to about thirteen point eight seconds so the difficulty bomb has Began to be kind of like kicked in here And you know that's going to keep going unless we kind of like delay it now I did say to you guys that I think block times would have gotten up to about 20 seconds in August Which would have been five I guess like six point five seconds more than you than normal here I but users may may have started filling it because essentially if the block times are going up That means there's kind of like I guess like less some less space for oh sorry That means they kind of like scalability goes down so to speak because the blocks coming in slower fees probably going to go up because people want to do you know do things a Quicker than the other people and then the people outbid each other and we have the normal kind of like fee market right so that's The chart that kind of shows that but yeah the TLDR is that the difficulty bombs going to be delayed until August And the merge is still being targeted for August But given that they have to now do a difficulty bomb delay Which isn't a difficult thing to do guys like it's very very easy for them to do The I guess like the most difficult thing is just coordination But given that that they're gonna have to do that that's gonna take a little bit of time away from Everything got to do with the merge that's gonna lead to a bit of kind of like coordination overhead The the merge may push into September because of that now I did say that I was highly confident that August would happen But I did say that if the difficulty bomb was to be delayed Then I would expect the merge to also be kind of like pushed back a little bit now That's not to say that the merge still can't happen in August. They could it could happen on like late August I would rule out like early or mid August Given that this cut that they've decided to delay the difficulty bomb and I actually think that the laying the difficulty bomb Is the correct choice because I think The problem is is that as I said like the block times would get like to 20 seconds or 20 25 You know depending on how long it would take would go 20 plus seconds And that would kind of like slow the chain down and users would start feeling that so you know given the fact that it's very Easy to delay it Why not just delay it and if it and if it kind of like results in a one to two week kind of I guess Push back of of the merge then I mean it's it's kind of like worth it And I do think so so at this point in time I would say that late August is still a possibility But it's more likely to be early September in my eye in my mind just given this rally and now again We have Shadow Fork 6 happening tomorrow. I believe the 31st of May and we have Ropsten going ahead on June 8th shut the Shadow Fork I expect to go through smoothly I don't expect any kind of like trouble with that or any kind of like surprises there Ropsten again I'm not expecting any surprises But that's going to be kind of like the big test like if Ropsten goes through really smoothly We obviously will move on to the next test and that's like Sepolia and Girly and if those all go through smoothly Then I think yeah early September could be could be kind of like that the target there I was still pretty set on August like if those things went smoothly if it wasn't for this difficulty bomb delay And I remember I said this like if the difficulty bomb wants to be delayed Then I would expect the merge merge timing to be pushed back But this is my estimations again guys like this is not the estimations of of anyone of anyone else This is my own personal ones, but I would err on the side of kind of like early September, but again It's not like it's it's much longer like really I mean would you like you are we really gonna feel like a mid to late August? Sorry early September rather than mid to late August. I don't think so so definitely just keep that in mind I know you guys are probably not kind of like trading around the merge Maybe some of you are but I think most of you are long-term investors So either way that's not really not gonna kind of like I guess hurt your positioning here at all But just kind of like from a knowledge point of view I would get I would definitely bet on Early September over over kind of like late August at this point in time But we'll have to see maybe they can do it by August You know maybe they'll surprise me and kind of like they can coordinate around August But I think they definitely want to give everyone in the ecosystem enough time to be ready for it So probably a month at least which you know for the merge And you know given the fact that they plot being ultra conservative about this sort of stuff Yeah, I would say early September is more likely here But you can read Tim Biko's kind of like core dev All core devs call kind of like thread breakdown for more details about this I'll also link this chart in the YouTube description below you can go check this out if you want to as well All right So I spoke about that seven block real that happened on the beacon chain last week And I kind of like went through a high level of overview of what happened But Barnaby from the Ethereum Foundation here has put together an absolutely amazing blog post Visualizing that real and going into detail about exactly what happened how it happened well You know what why we probably won't happen again in the future and the fixes that are kind of like in place for this I so I just wanted to kind of like hide this and say But I highly highly recommend you go to give this a read. It's very very simple to follow I think like it is technical it does go into a lot of things that you may not hear about often But the thing is is that it does that because I mean this is inherently technical stuff like it's protocol level stuff But I think Barnaby did an absolutely amazing job explaining all of this and visually as well like these are these are gifts here So this top one is a gift, so it'll actually animate exactly what happened, but as I kind of like discussed last week This isn't something that Will result in any delay of the merge or has any effect on the merge It's already a solved kind of like issue It was just the kind of thing where the nodes hadn't upgraded and that you know they needed to upgrade but essentially Everything's you know everything's fine. It's not a big deal, but definitely read Barnaby's blog post for a full breakdown on that All right so super fears posted on Twitter today a reddit comments are from space insider Who who's kind of like said the validator acceptance rate has increased from? 1125 per day to 1350 per day now as you guys know this is because that as more validators are kind of like accepted into the Beacon chain up to a certain amount once it reaches a certain amount we can add even more validators to the network at a time So it started off at 900 per day, then it went to 1125 per day now it's at 1350 per day, which is really really awesome to see the validated queue I believe is under 1000 right now I think one ended up happening was that a lot of the inflows from Lido stopped coming in because the st Eth peg kind of like deep egg there so Essentially what happens now if you stayed with Lido if you put eighth into Lido And then get st. Eth out you immediately take a loss you take a point to a point three Sorry point zero to a point zero three kind of like eighth loss or two to three percent loss Because of the fact that the st. Eth kind of like peg Is still but it's still kind of like it. I think point nine seven point nine eight So it's not it's kind of like not one for one still So people stopped kind of like staking with Lido for now But I mean I I'm not gonna argue about whether that's a good or bad thing I know there's a lot of discussion going on with Lido right now, and I will cover the more on that in the future I think once this governance proposal with Lido goes through about them limiting themselves on the network I want to see the outcome of that and I'll probably discuss it then but very very very cool to see that the The validator churn kind of maximum validator kind of like that can be entered into the beacon chain has increased The next increase will happen when there's 458 458 thousand seven hundred fifty two validators, and it'll increase from thirteen fifty to fifteen seventy five so cool to see this I think there's going to be a lot of validators coming in through a few other kind of like services I know that our rocker pool is doing a lot of good work Stakewise I think the swell networks going live soon. You know I wouldn't count like the The validator queue being kind of like almost empty now is any sign of the future I think it's a sign of basically Lido inflow slowing down But probably not inflows more generally and as the market heats up again I expect inflows to kind of like pick up again as well So we'll just have to kind of wait and see what happens there, but very very cool to see that the acceptance rates I was increased again today so I often get asked why the Minimum required aether mount to stake is 32 and people say you know was this an arbitrary kind of like Amount picked was it picked because of the the price of a like you know the price of a there was much law when it Was picked you know or was it picked for such-and-such reason well No, the actual reason why the 32th requirement exists is got nothing to do with the amount of e it's got to do with The amount of validators the beacon chain can handle and this is due to two key properties So the beacon chain can only handle a certain amount of validators before it starts becoming unstable Because what all the validators need to do is any to stay in sync with each other right they need to kind of like Vote on the same things and it's a kind of you know State that what's called the the head of the chain now the the two things to consider when? considering how many validators can be active on the network at any one time is signature aggregation and and networking related things now these are very technical things you can actually read about this in In the spec in the annotated spec as well from Ben Edgington but essentially as As hardware gets better and as we get better at kind of like doing signature aggregation and networking on the beacon chain We could actually lower that 32th Requirement and the goal is to actually lower that to something like 16th or 8th or maybe even for 8th one day We definitely want don't want it to be you know Obviously too high, but we definitely need to keep it high enough to you know based on the validate account to make sure that the chain remains stable so in the maybe in a year Maybe in a couple years or something it could be reduced to 16th by virtue of the fact that Hardware's and has gotten better with optimized better on the client side and thing and kind of like the core developers and core researchers Feel safe knowing you know being able to admit more validators to the network here And that would obviously open up participation to more people, but the thing is okay, so the thing is is that like even if Let me pose a scenario to you I think they will bring this up all the time because they're like you know 32 is out of reach of most people you know How can people solo stake if 32 it costs? What is it? Whatever it is today to that if it is $2,000 $64,000 I get that right, but let's let me let me pose a scenario to you guys Let's say the minimum 8th requirement was dropped to 40 now This is probably going to be a while before it drops to 40 because it require it would require a lot of improvements But let's say in five years the minimum 8th amount required drops to drops to 40 Alright for 8 at $2,000, but that's 8 grand 8 grand right? I think you know most middle-class people could could spare that right like in in first world countries. That's fine Well, I'm not spared Apple like that would make the investment right okay? That's 8 at 2,000 like if it is at 2005 years something is wrong So let's take the bear case of what it would be in five years, and I think that would be 10,000 I think it's probably going to be higher than that, but that's my own personal belief But let's just take the bear case so for either $10,000 is $40,000 okay there goes most people that can solo stake again Right so the solution in my mind is not to lower. I mean okay one of the solutions Yeah, is to lower the minimum 8th kind of like required amount, but it's not the only solution Because of the fact that that you can lower it as much as you want But the thing is if you theorem succeeds the eith price at what it's trying to do and if theorem keeps growing Which we all think it will the eith price is just going to keep going up and up and up So in saying that you need the I mean you need to work towards lowering the minimum amount required But you also need to make it easy for people to kind of like solo stake in other ways such as with decentralized staking pools So something like rocker pool right we need to encourage those solutions as much as we need to kind of like look at Lowering the minimum eith required amount and in saying that as well Lowering the minimum eith required amount to to stake would also lower the required amount for something like rocker pool as well Which would you know it would have downstream effects, which would be really cool, too So just some things to consider But there's this thread from tog roll here are going over this and going over this in more detail and more technicality So I highly recommend giving this a rate. I'll link in the YouTube description, but those are all the things to kind of like consider There so yeah I just kind of like wanted to highlight this thread from from tog roll and I expect kind of like explain it in my words as well All right, so another great thread from Bartek here about how roll eyes put transaction data on the l1 chain And no, this is costly obviously right now, but post 48 44 which is proto dank sharding fees will go down But let's see what it can go wrong if data is not posted on chain And it's exactly what Bartek kind of like goes through in in this thread So I highly recommend giving this to kind of like read here to understand that if data is not posted on the same Kind of like chain that the that that the the proofs are being posted to if data is kind of like posted elsewhere So if it's not settling on a theorem, it's settling something. It's gonna be posted somewhere else Then it is not a roll-up anymore. It is a validity M or it is an optimistic chain and bad things can happen So I think from from my understanding one of the worst things that could happen was that your funds can't be stolen But if the data is not available So for some reason if the data is off-chain and you can't get access to that data because the nodes are offline Then your funds essentially become frozen so you wouldn't be able to withdraw your funds No one can steal your funds, but you wouldn't be able to withdraw your funds So, I mean it's kind of like useless who cares if no one can steal your funds if you can't even withdraw them, right? so that's why I'm personally very kind of like Strict about not referring to things that don't post data on chain as a roll-up because they're not like they shouldn't be equated with Those things from a security perspective, but Bartik does a better job than me explaining it in this thread So I'll link it in the YouTube description and you can go check it out All right, so I put out this tweet today where I said inside me There are two rules one that is hyper giga bullish on ETH and can't stop buying it whenever possible and one that is hyper Giga bearish on 99% of tokens and coins and wonders how anyone can be redacted enough to buy them Redacted like a meme on Twitter not to say the other the other our word. Um, but basically It's kind of like funny trying to reconcile these two points because I think like I mean, obviously I'm really really bullish on ETH I've gone through the bull case for ETH many many times before I'm not gonna rehash it then but I'm so Bearish on so many coins and tokens. I think that the majority of them should literally be worth zero I don't know why they're not worth zero. No, I mean, it's hilarious. They even something like Terra classic is not worth zero anymore It's worth like 900 million or something It's just crazy like these these things just just play out right but the thing is is that When I kind of look at the rest of the ecosystem, I'm just kind of like well I don't think these things are gonna drag a down with them But like there are people holding these things there people have a thesis on them There are people who think that these things are going to you know Apple form you USD and Apple form eight like no like as I've explained to you guys before most things will not outperform either the long term even the things that people were like Really really bullish on for like a month or two and then you know, and then it kind of like goes down only from there I remember one of the kind of like things that people were really bullish on Especially during d5 summer was was uni now Unisop is obviously an amazing project keeps growing Uni token doesn't you need tokens being down only against ETH and even against USD, right? And then you can kind of look at ENS and other hyped up token projects amazing tokens not doing too Well, do I DX again project really good token not doing too well, there's plenty of examples of this So even the most hyped up things that people were like really excited about for maybe a month Maybe two months or even three months They've just failed to to outperform eight and obviously like now it's a bear market But the thing is is that uni came out at the end of 2020 Okay, it went through the whole bull market went up in USD but still underperformed eight and now in a bear market It's going down more than eight. So it's underperforming even more and then on the recovery It's gonna recover if it does recover much slower than something like eighth wood. So I'm not saying I'm bearish I'm just using you as an example. I'm not saying I'm bearish on uni Particularly. I'm just really really bearish and so much stuff out there that isn't even part of a successful project You need the token title is a successful project and that we all kind of like believe will be successful into the future I know there are some people who don't think you need stop is gonna be successful. I'm just using it as an example Please please don't kind of like that. I take that as it's kind of like anything It's just an example to illustrate my point here But there are like plenty of projects out there that have tokens associated with them But the projects going nowhere and those tokens will be down only forever. They'll be overshadowed by other tokens and other projects and everyone will just lose money on it basically or unless they kind of like sell maybe they can make some money or whatever but essentially that's kind of like what happens with most tokens and you can if you need proof you can just go look back at 2017 and 2018 and see what were the most hyped up tokens back then like I can think of plenty off the top of my head like Golem, for example was was very hyped up go look at golem today There was status which is a really hyped up ICO I mean even just on the on the NFT side crypto kitties right all that sort of sorts of stuff It's all pretty much dead now and but the thing is the status project still going believe the golem project still going um crypto kitties, I mean the creators of that created their own blockchain and then did some a bunch of weird things but you know There are still things kind of like going but the tokens are just dead right for one reason or another But you can go look and kind of look for yourself as well What what you can do is you can actually go to coin market cap and have like a historical snapshot feature Where you can look at? What this what the kind of like top 10 or top 20 or top whatever looked like? in say say you want to do the high of the last bull market do like November or December of 2017 and Kind of like look at what was there and then look at it today and look at it against us day and look at it Against eighth most of those things are not doing too hot So that's just an exercise if you guys want to go do that But anyway, I'm gonna power through the rest of these updates because I'm up on the 30 minute mark here Actually, this is something that I probably can't power through because I had a few thoughts about this But how's it quote tweeted our token terminal here, which has like a picture of how it started versus how it's going for obvious So are there the application started on aetherium now are the application is on various EVM chains and layer twos And then how's it quote tweeted this and said? Sometime in the next one to two years there will be a flippin ink from fat protocol thesis to fat application thesis The space is way over invested in l1 copycats. I totally agree with this I think that too many people piled into the l1 trade and at the expense of applications I think that there are a few application tokens out there that are undervalued I'm not going to name them because I don't want to give any investment advice But I do think there are some out there that are undervalued I haven't bought any of those or anything like that But in contrast to these l1s which just a sort of a valued there needs to be kind of like a flippin in here And there was some great discussion in the in the arm kind of replies here Into has whose thread that I saw has whose tweet that I would recommend you go look at But the TLDR of my thoughts on this is that applications are kingmakers for chains the change of the best Applications on them are the ones that are going to win there are too many chains You guys know I think this already too many l1 chains There's probably too many l2 chains eventually, but I at some point But eventually I think that we're just going to coalesce around you know one settlement layout Which I believe is going to be aetherium and a bunch of l2s that are going to settle to aetherium there will be applications Specific l2s that do well you know here and there But I think the juggernauts of the industry will be aetherium as a settlement layer and the layer twos as the execution layers And all that sort of stuff there And there will be other chains like enterprise chains and bespoke chains and and these other sorts of things that all exist But if we're talking about like what accrues the most kind of like activity and value I do think it's just going to be aetherium and a small Handful of kind of like l2s like the l1 trade in my eyes like not just because I'm an eth maxi But just it was it was just silly and you can look at the enterprises like how silly it is like A lot of these things are just down only like I mean phantom. I went through phantom I think a few weeks ago It's it's just wrecked absolutely wrecked like not just the price, but its ecosystem is dead harmony the same thing I don't hear anyone talking about harmony anymore Avalanche actually did an interesting thing recently where they cannibalize their own activity because what ended up happening was that an Avalanche project called crab Dara or crabada or something is some crab game moved off of the avalanche C chain which is the Avm chain to its own subnets and basically the avalanche C chain activity collapsed overnight I went down by more than 50% I think there was a study that was done that showed that that the crab game accounted for 50% just on its own But that was just its own contracts that wasn't including all the other contracts that it was interacting with Such as the decks and things like that So what ended up happening was that game moved to a subnet and all that activity moved off? So now the avax on chain activity on the C chance or the avalanche C chain activity is really really low and this subnet Basically has the activity but the thing about subnets is that they don't pay the C chain for their security They're not like L2s They're essentially separate blockchains That use kind of like validators from the C chain of the C chain validators can opt in to validate on these subnets and the subnets Can have their own tokens so like there's just kind of weird stuff going on in these other L ones that just the tokens like Make me so bearish on their tokens like I was I was already bearish on their tokens But like it's even worse now And it remains to be seen what the L2 tokens are gonna look like right like I got no idea And it remains to be seen what happens with the medic token obviously it's it's tied to the polygon POS chain right now But they're gonna have L2s coming out So I don't know what's gonna happen with that and I don't want to comment on things like the medic token because you guys know An advisor the polygon and I get compensated in token So I don't want to I don't like talking about things that I kind of like have a heavily heavy vested interest in besides eighth of course um, but you know It remains to be seen how the L2 tokens are gonna fit. I don't know there are already some out there like um Like dy dx which I actually consider more to be a defy token than an L2 token even though they're on their own L2 Loop ring I consider to be probably more defy than L2 even though they have like a whole L2 ecosystem It's kind of like weird how people kind of like bucket these things But it remains to be seen what the tokens like optimism and arbitrum do oh by the way I I feel like Optimism is gonna launch their token this week I just I have a feeling you guys know I'm an investor in optimism, but I haven't like heard anything This is not me giving you guys like any Privileged information. I just feel like from what I've seen the information that I've seen publicly like it's public information Kind of feels like it's gonna launch this week, so we'll see maybe that's gonna be kind of like what what kind of like Ignites maybe the next phase of the bull market. I don't know we'll have to see there But yeah just some of my thoughts there and just the last few things before I wrap up for today I just wanted to highlight that immutable protocol fees are now live now immutable for immutable X They have a really cool model for their protocol fees that I suggest you guys go and read about I've talked about fees before and how they're gonna work on L2 versus L1s And how you know we can prevent spam and all that sort of stuff there So I highly recommend going giving this blog post to read on the fees. I'll link it in the YouTube description I'm not gonna go over it now because I'm out of time just wanted to highlight that there And then also immutable has put forward a proposal to the ape coin down So the board ape stuff to get the I guess like board apes to move to a layer 2 on Ethereum basically to move to immutable instead of to another change so you can go read this proposal. It's really really great I like it. It makes a lot of sense. I think it would be beneficial to everyone if they if the Board a because just to move to an L2 instead of another chain obviously because it keeps it in the Ethereum family So definitely go check out this proposal and last up here. I just wanted to shout out there They feel the theorem foundation is currently searching for a hiring coordinator to help find great people for their community of teams and projects So if that's something that you may be interested in or something you think you have experience In the past or you think that you could be a good fit for you can go check this out I'll link this job in the YouTube description below and then you can go check out all the requirements and everything and maybe even apply If that's something you think that you could do, but I think on that note that's going to be it for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching Be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give it a thumbs up subscribe to newsletter join the discord channel And I'll catch you all tomorrow.

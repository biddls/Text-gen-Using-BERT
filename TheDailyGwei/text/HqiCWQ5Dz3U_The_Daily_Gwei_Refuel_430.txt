 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily grey refuel where I recap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host the andy sassano and today's 18th of august 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So an interesting kind of a tweet here from brian armstrong today Uh got to do with I guess like the censorship stuff that we've been talking about lately and the oafac stuff So basically on august 15th, which was three days ago left terrorists here asked a question to lido coinbase kraken steak Us and bitcoin suicier if regulators ask you to censor at the ethereum protocol level with your validators Will you a compliance sensor at the protocol level or b shut down the staking service and preserve network integrity now brian armstrong Obviously the ceo of coinbase here replied earlier today or I guess like my today So I think this is about 15 hours ago now And said it's a hypothetical we hopefully won't actually face But if we did we'd go with option b. I think got to focus on the bigger picture There may be some better option c or a legal challenge as well that could help reach a better outcome Now this is a very very strong signal as i've been talking about lately coinbase Really was between a rock and a hard place it had the choice to either You know censor and kind of risk the very real kind of um fact that they'll get Socially slashed as i've been talking about lately Or they can voluntarily exit their validators, which is basically what brian armstrong is saying here that they would do now There is kind of like nuance here. They can voluntarily exit their validators without suffering an inactivity penalty But the thing is is that there is a queue So the way you exit your validator is that you basically, you know issue kind of like the exit command so to speak And then your validator goes into an exit queue, but your validator has to stay online Until it is processed through the exit queue and you have exited the uh, I guess like validator set the active validator set If you are in the queue and you go offline you will you will suffer from an inactivity penalty Now the queue is limited to each day There's only a certain number of e that can enter an exit staking each day or I guess like a certain number of validators That can enter and exit the chain the beacon chain each day Which means that coinbase would not be able to exit all at once they would be waiting probably a month for that So they would have to wait literally a month to exit all of their stake and that's assuming that there's no other exits happening from Other places right? This is just assuming, you know coinbase's stake So that is a nuance there But I would say that I don't think coinbase would have to shut down their validators in that case if they were being forced to sensor the protocol level They could probably just fight that even if they knew they were going to lose They could just kind of like fight that and keep it tied up a bit They can just keep their validators online long enough for users or for kind of like their stake to to exit from the active Valorator set without suffering those inactivity penalties which would obviously be quite high For coinbase considering the amount of e they have at stake in the beacon chain So i'm i'm really happy that brian kind of like put this tweet out and signaled that they would rather go with option b Which is shutting down the staking service to preserve network integrity But at the same time I don't really think he or coinbase has a choice. Um, I think it's someone who replied uh, suza ha and basically said that said, you know, I appreciate this But it's not like you have a choice You will either be inactivity leaked or the community will slash you and all your customers if you try anything other than b Uh, so yeah, I mean that it's kind of like correct right like you can't censor like I mean you can like obviously Technically you can but the the point is and the point of this kind of like social signaling Around social slashing is the fact that you don't really give them a choice It's it's a kind of like, uh, as I wrote about in the newsletter yesterday mutually assured destruction Where it's like the ethene community is prepared to use the nuclear option of uh, socially slashing Uh, even a large entity like coinbase if they decide to start censoring on on the network And i've been through all the reasons of that the last few days. I'm not gonna kind of repeat myself here Uh, but yeah great to see this from brian obviously like, you know, it's just words at this point like brian It's a word. I don't know like how much you could you would trust it like you don't have to trust it at all It just depends on what they would actually do under that scenario But for sure, this is something that they're talking about internally their lawyers are all over it over this uh, and the better outcome would really just be To ensure that the you know, the us government, uh, creates regulations where it enshrines in law Or I guess like there's a precedent set in the courts that there is no uh, kind of like obligation on Validators or on minors to censor transactions, even if they've been sanctioned So for example, there'd be no legal obligation for any validator to censor transactions that uh that go to the tornado cash sanction addresses Uh for for example, right that would be the better outcome because then we don't have to worry about this sort of stuff And honestly like the us is obviously the most powerful entity within crypto for better or worse across a number of different verticals But as I said like that would be the best outcome in order to kind of like getting something enshrined in law So that we don't have to we still have obviously the social slashing option But so we don't have to enact that and there is no kind of like looming threat of that over these kind of platforms So I think that is the the better outcome there but great to see this from brian and I appreciate him for signaling this But again words are words We'll have to see when push comes to shove what they decide to do and I think I mentioned yesterday other day before I really Hope that beacon chain withdrawals come sooner rather than later because i've been talking about this great reshuffling for a few months now Actually, I think i've been talking about it for probably at least six months Probably at least six months. I think I started talking about it with regards to client diversity I really do think we're going to see a reshuffling of stake here Especially based on the events of the last couple of weeks because if you're staking with a centralized exchange and you're seeing all these people say Uh in the ethereum community say well if the centralized exchange starts Such as that's censoring transactions We're going to socially slash you those people are going to now suddenly realize how risky it is to be staking with a centralized exchange Entity, especially one based in the us and may decide to go stake with another entity Obviously the rocker pool ecosystem as the premier decentralized staking pool has gotten a lot better Um in you know in the la especially in the last six months and that will keep him Well, excuse me, and that will keep improving over time Uh, you know and by the time withdrawals are enabled it'll probably be much better than it is today So the and there's more options right there's more options, you know, if you staked a year ago in a centralized exchange Well in the last year, there's been more options that have come to market for you We centralized and decentralized in a year's time. There'll be even more options So that's why I think there's going to be that great reshuffling because more options for users and and kind of like these I guess like realizations that staking with these entities are super risky Is going to force people to want to stake With other entities and maybe someone uh kind of like put their eath into a centralized exchange staking And then they managed to stack 32 eath during the bear market and now they want to To well 32 eath with the eath that they have in say coinbase staking and now they want to solo stake There's definitely people that fall into that bucket as well So we're going to see that great reshuffling of stake once withdrawals are enabled but until then we're just going to have to keep I guess like The pressure on I think um and just generally signal to everyone that the ethereum community is willing to use the social Slashing nuclear option if we uh have to if we are forced to and you know That way we can like force these replies or force these kind of like stances from people like brian armstrong Which I think is very very positive So and speaking of I guess all of that I put out this tweet today where I just want to be very clear on What the two properties of ethereum that should be maintained at all costs are there's only two like These are the the two things that go hand in hand without these ethereum ceases to become a useful network And these two things are credible neutrality and censorship resistance And as I said, they go hand in hand because to be a credibly neutral network You need to process and execute every single transaction. No matter the origin no matter kind of like the person Uh receiving the the funds if it's a funds transfer it needs to remain Open to all to basically maintain that credible neutrality if we lose censorship resistance, we lose credible neutrality As I said in the tweet This is the most bearish thing that could happen to ethereum and we uh, you know Ethereum ceases to be a useful network There's been a bit of discussion uh lately as well about the fact that we have these centralized stable coins in ethereum like usdc Usdt and others and people say well, you know if we socially slash slash coinbase wouldn't they just make the coinbase kind of like chain with uh, You know the censoring transactions and they'd only honor usdc redemptions on that chain I mean, of course, that's always a risk But I don't think it would make much sense for them to do that And I think that them doing that is actually less bearish than maintaining ethereum's credible neutrality and and censorship resistance Even though that would be obviously disastrous It's still less bearish to me and i've used a recent example in the discord channel today of the terror ecosystem If you want to use a stablecoin example Ust was pretty deeply integrated with a lot of the ecosystem and it only came out after the fact how deeply integrated it was And not just that there were a lot of big players leveled up on The lunar token, uh, there was a lot of integrations across kind of like chain and a lot of integrations within terror itself And that blew up that went to zero the entire ecosystem basically was wiped off the face of the earth within three days, right? Did crypto die? No did like, uh, all the people all the um, uh, um, Chains that were connected to terror die. No what died was terror the entire ecosystem because they relied on Ust alone, right? So if you're looking at the worst case scenario of something failing I think the premier example of that is terror and the reason why terror has not been able to I guess like come back is because their entire ecosystem was centered around the ust stablecoin So that's the worst case scenario in terms of a blockchain failing, uh for reasons other than credible neutrality and censorship resistance reasons Now within ethereum, yes stablecoins like usdc and usdt and that are pretty widely intertwined with all the defi applications But I don't think that if for example usdc Or circle decided not to honor redemptions on the ethereum canonical chain and decided to honor them on like the coinbase chain For example, I don't think that would kill ethereum ethereum is much more than than these stablecoins I do think it would be very messy I do think that it would result in lawsuits for circle to be honest Uh, and all of that put together if you really think about the game theory here It makes sense for them to push back on I guess like any form of censorship Uh as much as possible, uh, you know at the base layer not I mean not at the smart contract layer because they already do that With with kind of like black listing addresses, but it's in their interests Especially in kind of coinbase interests to push back against this in order not to suffer any of that fallout So I think they understand this I think they understand the game theory behind this because when you really map it out And when you really think it out you only have to take like 10 minutes to think about all the implications here You can very quickly come to the conclusion of hey, we better not screw with the community here We better not screw with uh, with you know, risking socially slashing our validators and we better not kind of signal to Anyone that we're not going to honor redemptions because it's going to open us up to a lot of legal liability It's going to open us being coinbase It's going to open them up to a lot of uh, I guess like customer complaints and their business is going to suffer because of that Now obviously, you know nation states forcing coinbase to censor at the protocol level with their validators Is uh, I guess like outside of the incentives that they have as a business but as I said and as brian signaled They'd rather shut their validators down than do that because I do think that it would harm their business materially if they did that because they'd lose Not only their staking business if that happened they'd lose a lot of customers their reputation would get hit very very hard So the better option for them is to shut down their staking business rather than get all their customers Slashed in a social slashing event and then have to try and communicate that to their customers saying hey You know the us government forced us to censor. This is why all your eath is gone like that's just not going to happen Right that would that would quite possibly destroy coinbase's entire business which obviously is uh, is kind of like the worst case scenario for them So shutting down the eath staking portion of their business would obviously hurt their bottom line, but it wouldn't destroy them Whereas the other kind of conclusion would so That's why I think that uh, you know the game theory checks out there and and that's why i'm gonna put out this tweet And that's why i'm gonna put out this tweet where I said these two properties are all that matter to ethereum And that's why it doesn't matter how many other bearish scenarios you come up with In my opinion the most bearish thing is ethereum losing these two properties if we lose those As I said the other day, I would leave ethereum no more daily way guys, right? And i'm talking about like permanent censorship resistant, uh censorship here on the base layer and uh, obviously that would uh, Definitely get rid of ethereum's credible neutrality. And as I said the other day, it would make ethereum a way less interesting network. So I just wanted to kind of highlight that for you guys. Uh, I think i've got another tweet here if my mouse wants to work There we go Uh, yes, okay some positive news out of uh flashbots. So flashbots has now open sourced their flashbots relay This was actually meant to come as part of their roadmap later on But they sped up the development of this or at least the open sourcing of this because of the recent oafac actions And I quote tweeted this and I said thanks oafac because this is actually a net positive now, right? They've actually forced the ecosystem not only to talk about the censorship risks Uh and kind of like bring them to the forefront of what we're talking about Even though we have talked about them in the past. It's kind of like obviously more top of mind now But it has also forced flashbots which is at the protocol layer to open source their relay Now what does this mean? It basically means that our other kind of players in the ecosystem can run flashbots relayers And they don't have to censor flashbots has already signaled that they're going to be uh, kind of like censoring With their relay are uh, the the sanctioned addresses addresses, but I believe there's blocks route which is not I don't believe he's going to be censoring but he's going to give the option So there's going to be like a flag in there for people to use or something like that And manifold as well which is I don't think going to censor at all and those are only three there can be other relayers Out there that that kind of like exist and you can choose which one that you want to be part of now This is a stopgap solution until we get things like pbs where it basically makes it hard very very hard if not impossible for Any censorship to occur even at the kind of relay level, but this is really really awesome to see I'm very happy that flashbots is doing this. Yes. I'm not happy that they're kind of like going to be censoring those sanctioned addresses But i'm very happy that they open source this because it means that other people can now build and and kind of like operate Their own relayers rather than relying on on flashbots. Yeah, so very awesome to see that And another bit of good news is something here from david mihal Who where he shared a way to block the quote unquote narque where on uniswap avi and balancer ui So you can add the following URLs to your filters in brave or to ad block and it'll basically a block Kind of like that I guess like trm lab software and any of the other screeners that are on there Which are the censorship checks I guess so to speak they'll basically block them on your end Which is very very cool to see I don't know how long this would last for You know all it would take would be the url to be changed and you'd have to keep updating it and things like that Uh, and it could even be done at kind of like a different level not even just like the url level So it might you know, it might not work forever, but it could work right now for you if you'd like to do this But I don't think any of these finance right now are censoring Anything but the sanctioned addresses, I believe I don't think they're censoring people like me who got Kind of like sent tornado cache 8 from tornado cache after the sanctions So yeah, but still even if they do decide to do this you can you can use this and I do want to make Another note here. I think I've mentioned this on the last couple of refills, but I really want to make this clear to everyone You shouldn't ever expect decentralization or censorship resistance from a centralized front end your expectation should be that the centralized front end is Going to censor you at some point. It's going to censor you in some way at some point And in order to protect yourself against that you should look for alternatives and make sure that you know What alternatives exist and are available to you to get around that because like i'm sorry Yes, it sucks that they're doing this guys, but like the it's it's it's it's this kind of like thing of Expecting the expected like it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that centralized front ends are doing centralized front end things and at the end of the day the front end is like the least of my worries in terms of censorship because We can work around that very very easily like it's super easy for anyone to spin up a front end like a basic web developer can can do this and even a basic kind of like A user that's following just like a a simple guide can do this as well. It's it's not a difficult thing to do So I just wanted to be clear there that I don't think it makes sense to equate front end level censorship with base layer censorship Or smart contracts or any of the other layers that i've talked about in the past It's definitely very different and definitely the least of my worries at least as well So yeah, but I think that's going to be the last bit on the censorship side of things moving on to some merge updates So the merge mainnet readiness checklist is now all checked out. I haven't checked in on this For a little while, but I remember kind of like highlighting this on the refuel when basically no items were checked out quite a while ago And now you can see every single item on this checklist is checked. Oh, well, I guess like There's a few items left here, which is the uh rnd items Which I guess like uh is not going to do with the the main items the main kind of like items getting it ready for production here Which is awesome because I mean the merge is still less than a month away It's coming on the mainnet this recent I guess censorship stuff hasn't Delayed the merge or anything like that even though a lot of people are calling for a delay in the merge Which is just hilarious to me. It hasn't stopped it there So just a great feeling a historic day as I I replied to tim's tweet by saying, you know This is a historic day that we're we're we're basically almost there We're just kind of like counting down the days now and there is an all-call dev call happening this week where the I guess like formalities will be We made will you know the merge ttd has already been kind of like merged into into the code? So it's all basically official but on the all-call devs call on friday It'll be kind of like that rubber stamp of approval to basically say, you know that we're you know, we're merging we're merging right? Which I guess is a huge kind of like Weight off the shoulders of all the core devs and researchers and all the years worth of work that have gone into that They deserve a break like I know we want things like beacon chain withdrawals and proto dang sharding and stuff like that But if anyone deserves a break for a little bit it's the core devs and researchers and it's really cool that devcon is happening After the merge I think about a month after the merge So hopefully they'll be able to kind of like go to that relax for a bit, you know Enjoy enjoy their time there but other than that but even still like they should they deserve time off to spend with their fans And things like that as well because of all the hard work that they've done to get us to this point And i'm sure the long hours that they've put into this so kudos to all of them for the work here Really great to see that this readiness checklist is all checked off All right. So speaking of the merge mario have all here shared that the updated merge ready docs are ethereum.org About ethereum notes are finally published You can check it out at this ethereum.org link, which I will link in the youtube description below So this is the nodes and clients page on ethereum.org which has all the up-to-date information and everything that you need to know In terms of running an execution layer note and a consensus layer node to get your kind of like, uh, I guess like fully self-sovereign Self ready for the merge so you can definitely check this out. I'll link in the youtube description below I just wanted to highlight it for you guys there And last up on the core dev side of things there is a go ethereum or geth ama Happening right now in on reddit. Uh, there's a lot of great questions and answers there I would definitely recommend going and checking it out and giving it all a read i've yet to read it But uh because it's still it was still ongoing I want to wait till it's finished but uh, i've already kind of like skimmed through it and seen a lot of great questions and answers Yeah, so if you're interested in anything ethereum, I mean, I don't think it's just kind of like got to do with geth I think it's got to do with everything ethereum or at least most things ethereum. You should definitely check this out Or at least most things ethereum you should definitely check this out. I'll link it in the youtube description below All right. So how press is out with his new I guess is the e emerge is the emerge priced in article in bankless Now this is the I guess article or um report that he's been working on for quite a while. I believe it is 25 pages So it is very very long It basically pulls together all of his thinking around the merge and why he's so bullish on the merge trade and obviously him and ryan berkemans did a A live stream with bankless recently which you can check out here as well and how has uh, I think how did another podcast recently with the uh, With um, the person squish chaos who did the triple harvening and uh one other person Uh, I can't remember his name. I think he publishes the e if you're in revenue reports His name escapes me right now But you know how has been very very busy lately, which is cool to see and you guys know he's he's you know overall thesis but I think that uh this this kind of like process brings it all together and Reading it was kind of hilarious because I was like reading through it and I mean I I I kind of like found myself just skipping over the parts that I already knew of course because i'm so kind of like Clued into this stuff already but still reading all of it and reading how's view of things. I was like, wow I'm getting getting bullish again. Like how has that that effect on me? He just makes me more bullish than than I usually am. Uh, and i'm here to listen to these podcasts Actually, i'd be meaning to listen to it here. I'm hoping that's just as bullish as the as the blog post Um, but I just wanted to put it on your radar everyone You can go check it out and give it a read it'll be linked in the youtube description But the merge is less than a month away now. I don't know what the price action is going to look like honestly it's kind of funny because People are saying that we pumped up, uh, because of the merge narrative, right? We came off the lows and we came up to whatever price right now 1800 or whatever because of the merge narrative But then other people are saying well, no, it was just the the market kind of like bouncing off that irrational low And crypto following us the stock market, which is also bounced But then you can kind of point to the e Bitcoin ratio and how much out performance has happened there Which is not usual for bear markets usually in bear markets e bleeds against Bitcoin So I actually do think there's an al there's like an element of both of those things where it's just a general market rally um both in the stock market and in crypto, but also got to do with the merge hype with ethereum specifically where ethereum is rerating itself against other assets like Bitcoin and and kind of like marching upwards and you know The ratio is that 0.08 again? Uh double from here is a flippening, right? So I mean not just like I I do believe in the flippening obviously But like I don't know when it's gonna happen, right? If any if it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen post merge probably because of those structural flows kind of collapsing there I mean, I don't think people realize that for six or twelve months after the merge issuance is effectively zero because no one there's no There's no issuance coming to market. Obviously issuance is not zero on the beacon chain It's still being issued but no new ETH can come to market for that period so That might be a narrative in of itself that causes the price to go up. I don't know like I honestly have no idea I obviously am bullish on ETH long term, but the amount of kind of like Narrative trades that people try to do the amount of hedging that's going on as well like that popular trade right now is basically To buy spot ETH so just buy ETH on a normal open market and then short future futures ETH so you're delta neutral So that you know, no matter which way the price goes you're not taking on any kind of like risk You're not taking on any losses But you're also not taking on any gains and the reason you would do this is because you want to capture any of the forked Assets that happen post merge which there probably will be at least one proof of work chain that has some economical value So it would make sense to do that But then on the other side of things is like when those shorts close like it could lead to another kind of like reflexive I guess event in the market that pushes ETH even higher and Arthur Hayes wrote about this in his recent blog post I know Hal Press has spoken about it before and a few other people as well So it's kind of hard to know what what's gonna happen And this is why I'm a long-term investor because you can look at all the short to medium term things you can formulate a thesis You can kind of think really hard about it, but at the end of the day Like you can think as hard as you want about it But like it's just extremely hard to take advantage of it is extremely able to take advantage of it in the short term Because you know human emotions get in the way things change overnight You know Maybe you sold all of your eighth because of all the the tornado cash Censorship and and all that sort of stuff and that wasn't a profitable trade from what I can see I think we went up to 2k but we really only went down to 1800 so you would have had to like Get you know get the exact top and exact local bottom there It's just it's very hard trading is not an easy thing to do the best traders are there because of like Many many years worth of experience and many many years worth of taking on losses as well And you know, I guess like if everyone was a good trader if everyone could trade then no one would be because there'd be no Alpha to be had right? So yeah, but i'm gonna i'm gonna kind of like leave it at that there I'll link this in the youtube description this post and you can go check it out from hell here All right So speaking of coinbase just before coinbase wallet and users can now bridge assets between ethereum and polygon directly in the browser extension So this is I guess coinbase's browser extension, which is an alternative to metamask here And you can see that you can essentially bridge directly between ethereum and the polygon pos chain Which is obviously a very welcome for polygon users and for ethereum users Which i'm sure the venn diagram of polygon and ethereum users is pretty much a circle at this point And there's kind of like no coinbase fee either on this for a limited time network fees obviously still apply So you can see the nice interface here of the bridge you can kind of Go and use it if you're using coinbase wallet. I believe it's live in the extension today All right, so last up here i'm going to do a little bit of a rant over something that's come out of canada with new Regulatory changes here. So apparently On canadian centralized exchanges you are now allowed to buy as much btc eth ltc and bch as you want But any other crypto has a limit of 30k net buy per year But this is dependent on your network So I think the 30k buy limit is depending on a net worth of 400 000 And then you you have like a higher limit the higher your net worth is and I don't know the exact kind of figures for the other Other ones but it's not 30k for anyone but this is stupid for a number of reasons, right one It's basically bringing the accredited investor like laws to buying crypto It's basically the government telling you that you can only buy this amount of crypto on a centralized exchange Per year, right, which is which is kind of like insane. Um, and I guess like in the name of protecting investors Three the government is sanctioning literally sanctioning or I get not sanctioning in the in the in the kind of like sense With regards to ofact but like sanctioning as in like giving their blessing to Btc eth ltc and bch as the only assets that are considered the gold standard Okay, btc and eath fair enough, but litecoin and bitcoin cash. What the fuck what the hell? Like seriously, that doesn't make any sense. Both of those assets have severely underperformed The market, uh for a long time now, they're completely irrelevant So why like where does this come from? I don't know but I find that to be incredibly stupid Um, and I also just find the limits to be incredibly stupid as well But if I was to still man the argument here, I would say that okay most people most market participants Don't know what they're doing, right? They really don't I mean i've said it before and i'll say it again If you need if you want to learn how to properly invest in crypto markets You have to survive a few cycles to get there. It's not going to happen in your first cycle So it's really the government kind of like trying to protect people from themselves Which as I said, if i'm still manning it I can understand but it's taking freedom away from people like i'm afraid I I don't know if I classify myself as a freedom maximalist It sounds kind of weird when I say that but i'm all about giving people as much freedom as possible Um, but this just goes against that in saying that I'm not going to be a free person In saying that it's not like you can't withdraw your crypto to you know I guess like defi or something like that or to another exchange and just buy with uh with with kind of that, right? This is just for canadian-based exchanges, I believe but still it just seems very I don't know It seems very authoritarian to me like I know that's a big word to use But it's literally kind of like pussy putting these really hard limits on uh, the can you know? Canadian citizens of what they can buy and basically saying to them Hey, like we don't you know, we don't think you should be able to buy more than this amount because essentially We don't think you're smart enough with your money and the net worth requirements are insane too Like up to I mean up to 400 000 net worth is only 30k So like I mean after that it gets bigger and bigger but like most people don't have a net worth of 400 000 right, uh Or over so they're going to be limited to 30 000 a year guys like this is annual This is not something that uh is kind of like monthly or or daily or weekly It's yearly yearly. That's crazy. I mean like what who cares like? Um, okay. Okay. I'm getting a bit rantsy. I'm trying to stay on topic but like just as an example So why is there a buy limit on this but there isn't a buy limit on other things you can go Gamble away all your money, right? You can go put as much money as you want into gambling No one's going to stop you from doing that you can go buy anything you want with any amount of money There's no limits on on on most if not all other things as far as I know in canada That you can kind of like buy here. So what like why are they doing this just with crypto? I mean as I said, I know why because they're trying to I guess like quote unquote protect investors But it still to me just seems very Weird and especially weird that they would kind of like select ltc and bch if they're trying to protect investors Because that's definitely not protecting anyone Uh, and they're picking favorites here. So it's not i'm just i'm not just trying to pick on those two assets But they're really picking favorites here, which I don't think is something that a regulator should be doing either But uh, but anyway, i'm going to leave that one at that. I just wanted to highlight highlight it because I thought it was insane I hope that doesn't come to australia. I really hope it doesn't because like then it's kind of like, okay Well, I can only uh, uh buy x and x amount of crypto. How am I going to buy those big e-tips guys? Anyway, i'm going to leave it at that. Thank you everyone for watching and listening Be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give that video a thumbs up if you haven't uh, oh, jesus I'm i'm jumbling up the ending here subscribe to the newsletter join the discord channel and i'll catch you in the next one I know and i'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone

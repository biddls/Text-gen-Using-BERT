 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Deadly Way Refuel where we cap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Tanner Tisano and today's the 17th of February 2022. Alright everyone, let's get into it. So some big news out of Twitter today that I don't think many people were talking about and I guess like that just shows how quiet the ecosystem is right now, but basically Twitter now let's use its Ethereum addresses as a mobile tipping option. So when you're kind of like going to I guess like into your settings and going to the tipping settings, you can now add an Ethereum address there for people to tip you. So that's obviously pretty big, right? It's a pretty big integration for Ethereum. It's pretty funny how all these integrations seem to be coming after Jack left Twitter like as kind of like CEO and you know as we all know, Jack is a bit of a Bitcoin maximalist. So you know I've said it before and I still think this is the case. I think he left because they wanted to do this sort of stuff. They wanted to get more involved with Web3, they wanted to get more involved with NFTs, they wanted to do more things like what they're doing with Ethereum, mobile tipping here and I mean I guess I get it like I mean his beliefs are different. He doesn't believe that anything except Bitcoin is interesting. That's okay I guess but like for him to leave his own company as CEO over it is pretty shocking. Now that's not confirmed or anything like that. That's just speculation on my part but I think it's a pretty good thing to speculate on but that's not what I wanted to focus on. What I wanted to focus on is the fact that Ethereum has another major integration under its belt. Now I don't think this is an integration with a layer 2 specifically but the thing is the cool thing is with Ethereum addresses is that they're portable across layer 2s right. You have the same address on a layer 2 as you do on layer 1 Ethereum. So even if someone was to send you funds on layer 2 using that Ethereum address you'd be able to access it using the same address on just on that layer 2 even if you're not there. So for example if I you know send you I guess like some ETH on Arbitrum and you haven't used Arbitrum before on that without that address it doesn't matter that address is still yours it would still register on Arbitrum as the same thing so you'd be able to go to Arbitrum withdraw that ETH out of there back to mainnet if you wanted or send it wherever you want to do whatever you wanted with that. So that's I think the really cool thing about about layer 2s but you know on that note as well I think that a lot of people already had their Ethereum addresses on their kind of like Twitter profiles being that they had their ANS name in their name like sassle.eth is obviously linked to an Ethereum address so this sort of stuff is obviously more for the the mainstream but I hope that the next phase is for them to kind of like put in ANS integration because that would be really cool like I think the fact that they've done this is a good first step but I mean it feels like they're a little bit behind here still because to be honest whenever I try to share an Ethereum address with anyone and it's one of my public addresses I like to share the ANS it's just so much easier and I think we're not going to get mass adoption without people just kind of like using ANS or something similar to it because when you think about it the web didn't get mass adoption through IP addresses right we have the DNS system because there's no way in hell that people were going to type and remember IP addresses kind of like into into a browser right if you would if you want to go to Google you don't type in Google's IP address you just type in google.com and that's even further abstracted away I mean if you use Chrome for example you can just like search in the in the URL bar and it'll take you straight to Google but like it goes for any website right like no one's going to remember the IP address I don't even know what Google's IP address is I don't know what any of the websites that I visit every day's IP address is I mean I visit Twitter like 100 times a day I have no idea what Twitter's IP address is and the same is going to be true for Ethereum addresses I mean it's even worse with Ethereum addresses because at least with an IP address it's just a bunch of numbers that you would have to memorize and you know it's not that many numbers you know relatively speaking but within Ethereum address it's like a massive string of characters and there's no way you're ever going to remember it I mean you could attempt to memorize one or two addresses and if you've got a really good memory you could probably go further than that but most people are not going to do that it's just an exercise in futility that's why ENS is obviously a very huge thing like instead of remembering 0x blah blah blah whatever my address is I just have to remember sassle.8 well obviously a lot easier to remember and same goes for pretty much everyone that I know in Ethereum that has an ENS name same thing like Eric Conner my co-founder of Ethub has eric.eth so I just kind of like know that if I want to interact with him on chain in a public way eric.eth is the best way to kind of like do that there so I think this is a good first step for twitter but I'm hoping that they kind of like doing ENS integration next and I'm hoping that they do some I guess direct L2 integrations as well because I mean it's cool that you can send funds to L2 so it doesn't really matter that they don't have a direct integration but I think that a direct integration would be really cool because it basically means that people could onboard directly to the layer 2 and then kind of do all their stuff in there instead of having to kind of like have this hybrid approach where they're going with with layer 1 and tipping doesn't make any sense on layer 1 I mean to be fair tipping doesn't make sense even on kind of like layer 2 today especially the generalized layer 2s maybe it makes sense on something like a validity where essentially the costs are negligible but I mean optimistic roll-ups for example a swap is like what 1 to 2 dollars which means sending assets around is behind the last I haven't checked in a little while maybe like 50 cents or something at current gas prices and that obviously isn't going to stay like that that's way too much for tipping because like usually when you tip someone it's not like a large amount it may be like 10 bucks so if you're tipping someone 10 dollars and uh 50 cents is going to a transaction fee well that's five percent of your tip already gone and that's five percent that's not going to the person that you're tipping uh and it gets even worse if you're if you want to tip them like a couple of bucks and the transaction fee is 50 cents well then yeah it's only 25 uh or is going to a fee there so I would like to see uh twitter integrate with with a layer 2 or a validity maybe they can then spin up their own that'd be really cool right spinning up their own kind of I guess tipping l2 or tipping validity and where people can kind of like onboard via fiat and then do tipping in there sort of like what twitch does where I don't know how many of you guys are aware of this but twitch has their own uh it's not a crypto but it's like a it's like a point system or something uh I can't remember the exact name of it where you pull you know you buy these things with with fiat and then you kind of like have them and then obviously they're just entries in a centralized database on twitter's side but you can kind of like use those as as money and to tip people and to send them to people I think they're called bits um and you know that is done for I guess like the funny thing is that I think the reason they did that is because people are much more likely to throw away these things than they are kind of like fiat so just get you know it's kind of like a psychological thing but I think that that could kind of like work for crypto as well so looking forward to seeing you know some more integrations happening here but great to see twitter taking the first step uh with with this for today so roel from the prior labs team put out a great tweet just before where he said the amount of high quality research in ethereum and its openness is astounding the spec the specs for the merge sharding and beyond all have contributors from different walks of life and conducted publicly uh if you're a dev the high signal to noise ratio is in ethereum bar none now I want to give a little bit of context and background here so back in the I guess like earlier days of bitcoin I would say pre-2015 days uh the bitcoin talk forums were very very active and they weren't just active for the sake of being active they were very active in that it was the main place to be if you were discussing new kind of like ideas for crypto new kind of like use cases that you wanted to build research that you wanted to do and especially in maybe even the earlier days like 2012 2013 ish maybe even earlier than that a lot of people talking about doing this stuff on bitcoin and you'll be surprised about what you can find in those in those forums there's things kind of like alluding to things like dowels and defi and even nfts but of course we all know that bitcoin is extremely limited it can't really do anything other than you know secure btc and that's how the community wants it and of course once the block size war started heating up in I believe late 2015 early 2016 and there was a another path for people to kind of like go down in ethereum because ethereum launched mid-2015 what ended up happening was that all those people that wanted to build those things and were following those early bitcoin talk are kind of like posts and and doing research there what they essentially did was um they basically brain drained to ethereum and started doing that stuff on ethereum like a lot of early ethereum people are bitcoin og's like a lot of them surprisingly i mean vitalik himself is a bitcoin og and he started in bitcoin um he was writing for bitcoin magazine um and things like that and then he obviously uh kind of like i founded ethereum and the rest is history there uh but like to a rules point here a lot of these people brain drain to ethereum and now we have a new kind of like forum called e3 search and a lot of you probably have visited e3 search before it is the main hub i believe for bleeding edge research on a bunch of different kind of like areas such as cryptography consensus layer 2 stuff there's so much going on there and as role says like the the specs for like the merge sharding and beyond um have contributors from all different walks of life and these specs and the research was done out in the open on e3 search and that's why all these kind of like people from around the world from different walks of life have been able to join in and have been able to kind of like be part of this it's not like a centralized company or a big like fin tech or technology company that basically does everything behind closed doors before they're ready to release a product and you have to actually work for that company to contribute to it no there is no company that you have to work for to contribute to ethereum research or ethereum development it is totally out in the open anyone is able to contribute to it and there's no kind of like barrier to entry you can be completely anonymous and contribute and you're judged solely on your work which i think is uh you know just just absolutely awesome to begin with like i'm i'm someone who judges people based on their merit i don't give a shit about anything else like if you're doing good work if you're like if you have a lot of merit behind you if you've got a great track record behind you um doesn't matter if you're anon if you're doxed if you're this if you're that i don't care uh i judge people based on their work and you know a lot of the highest kind of like signal to noise in crypto is within ethereum and within the work that ethereum do like i have so much respect for ethereum core developers and researchers and builders that have been around in ethereum for a long time doesn't matter what they're building like dowels defi nfts i just have so much respect for those kinds of people because they've been you know especially the ones have been around for a long time because they've stuck with it right they truly believe in what they're building they're not just here for a get rich get rich quick scheme or anything like that they really want to change the world and they really want to build stuff and they do it out in the open and it's you know they're trying to make it decentralized uh they're open to criticism you know that's actually uh i guess like a curse of developing things out in the open is that you get a lot of criticism and everyone gets to see how the sausage is made i've kind of like discussed this before but imagine if you got to see how the first iphone was made from conceptualization to production imagine seeing all the features that were kind of like cut all the research that was um you know basically scrapped because it didn't end up working out all the trials and tribulations um that's what you see within ethereum that's why ethereum suffers so much criticism because people see things changing like the roadmap changing or things being cut or things being simplified because it just makes more sense and then people criticize ethereum and say wow wow the ethereum roadmap changed again because it turns out you can't actually do this and we told you so blah blah blah but the thing is and the point is and elon musk actually tweeted about this today i can't find the tweet right now but everyone's going to tell you not everyone but like a lot of people are usually going to tell you that you're going to fail it doesn't make much sense and you may agree with them but you're going to do it anyway a lot of people within the ethereum ecosystem they build things anyway they don't care that everyone's telling them that it's going to fail that it doesn't make any sense that it's pie in the sky the whole point is that we get to build this stuff and trial this stuff out in the open you know people will make money people will lose money people will kind of like build uh world-changing products and some of them will go to zero and some of them won't you know won't make any dent in history at all but we keep doing it we keep building we keep doing the research out in the open and that's i think one of the most special things about the ethereum community and exactly what i wanted to highlight with roles tweet here so um yeah i mean i'm sure a lot a lot of you have seen this if you haven't visited e3 search yet it's ethe research uh but then like ch as the tld so e th r e s e a r dot ch you can just google it it's probably easier um and then you can go there and you can just read you can just read for hours and hours and hours about all this stuff obviously a lot of it is going to be technical because it's bleeding edge stuff but if you're into that you have to be on e3 search and you know if you're not if you're if you're kind of like not technical and you just want to wait for things to kind of like come down the grapevine that's fine too i'm your you know i'll be covering uh all the kind of like major things as i normally do but if you really want to be on the bleeding edge and e3 research is definitely the place to be all right another little mini thread from pollina today where they said when the blob carrying transactions eip is implemented it's very likely optimistic roll-ups on ethereum will be cheaper than zk roll-ups at that point with the cost of call data pretty much resetting to zero the bottleneck will be the roll-ups cost with significantly lower proving and batch costs for optimistic roll-ups it will have an advantage over zk roll-ups of course ors are continuing to optimize fees there's probably 10 times efficiency as low hanging fruit evm based ors potentially also have fewer sequencer bottle decks right now then pollina continues of course zk roll-ups have many other advantages and over time we'll see pivoting uh sorry we'll see proving and verification costs plummet as the tech matures as well as sequences optimized long term i expect ors to either become zkr or replace their fraud proving system with validity proofs so what does this all mean in plain english well if you want to see the eip for blob carrying transactions you can just google it it should come up but what this basically means is that there's this new ip out there right now to implement something that is going to make optimistic roll-ups much cheaper than what they are today and this is separate i believe to ip4488 which is another i guess improvement coming here so as i've said before we're going to get to uh i guess like swaps on optimistic roll-ups probably getting below you know 50 cents 10 cents before we know it and this is before any of the zk evm stuff comes out or anything like that as pollina says like long term um you know ors are probably going to end up becoming zkrs and all that good stuff there but this is probably in the in the much longer term i think ors are definitely going to be around for quite a while here especially if their costs kind of like i guess uh approach you know under 10 cents for a swap like that i mean i've talked about the sweet spot for fees before that is just astounding right like and this is a swap that's that that's inheriting ethereum security i know optimism right now along with pretty much all the other l2s are centralized uh because of their training wheels and their controls and things like that but the the thing is is that those training wheels and those centralized controls could be taken away today and the cost would still be the same right and the cost would still be as cheap once these once these upgrades are implemented so i think that while obviously it's a risk that it's still centralized and still got the training training wheels on you still get to inherit that kind of like ethereum security anyway and uh without those controls you it would still be kind of like the same cost and same kind of like operating uh uh the same way it operates basically so i'm very much looking forward to this obviously this eip is not going to get implemented until at least after the merge merge still seems to be on track uh i haven't heard anything any you know i guess like uh anything about like major bugs being discovered or things being discovered that would push back the date there's no date i mean you know when i say push back the date i mean like that june target that that the um core developer core developers are trying to get to um but maybe we'll hear something soon but yeah i mean none of this stuff is happening until after the merge anytime i bring up a new eip that people are excited about don't expect that before you know the earliest i guess probably end of the year at this point with shanghai maybe you know if the merge goes really well we may see it in kind of like q4 uh but like if if this if if the merge kind of like ends up happening in july or august then i would probably wager that shanghai wouldn't happen till early 2023 so still a little while away for these sorts of things but they are major upgrades they are coming it's just that we need to get this merge thing out of the way we just needs to get done i mean obviously as i've said to you guys before the merge isn't actually an upgrade for end users really at the end of the day the end users aren't going to feel anything different about the ethereum network whereas things like um blob carrying transactions eip eip4488 and a bunch of others out there that have been proposed for shanghai they will uh sorry users will feel that because obviously fees are going to get cheaper on l2s much cheaper on l2s and that will directly impact users so i think we've got time like as i said at the start of the of today's episode the market is super quiet right now which means the ecosystem is super quiet there's not many active users in the ecosystem right now which is good i like these periods it gives builders time to kind of like focus heads down building build out the infrastructure for the next time we have like a mass inflow of people which i i do believe can end up happening sooner than people think uh you know all it takes is for the the price action to get positive again i know i know eat is back over 3k right now but that's nothing i think until it gets back above 4k i'm not even blinking because you know if you look at look at it from a market structure perspective uh eith on the weekly chart uh needs to close kind of like above 4k to basically signal to the market that it's back in a bull market so until that happens i don't expect any kind of like feverish kind of i guess retail investors to come back maybe they do stuff in the nft ecosystem but even that slowed down now uh but it's good i mean this is not a bad thing guys it's good because we get to keep building we get to keep focusing on on basically uh improving the infrastructure for the users when they actually do end up coming back and you know we do get incremental users during these periods of time and we do get incremental integrations and things like that and that just leads to kind of like bigger things happening when those users flood back in so so yeah all right so oasis has an update today so just a reminder for you guys oasis is an nft marketplace that is built on stark net so you can now actually try it out it's on it's at testnet.playoasis.xyz it has profile pages nft asset pages historical data infinite scrolling ipfs for all mint and nfts uh that are minted through the website and uh they say one last thing here uh and i'm not sure what the one last thing is uh it says uh i don't know just a bunch of emojis here maybe i should should jump into and uh jump into and try it out i haven't tried it out yet i just came across this before but i wanted to cover it for you guys because this is on stark net like as i've said to you guys stark net they're stuck in ecosystem sorry the stock net ecosystem is uh plodding along very very nicely right now and it's awesome that oasis is already live there i think nft marketplace is obviously a huge deal uh and you know they're going to be some of the most massive marketplaces on the planet i mean they already are like open sea is already one of the biggest marketplaces on the planet uh but it's great to see more than just ones that are on ethereum mainnet obviously there's treasure that's on arbitrum and now we have oasis that is on stark net so definitely go check out the testnet have a play around with it uh because you know i guess like it's something new to play around with on ethereum so speaking of l2s hash flow is now live on arbitrum you now can trade usdt usdc and a eth which is i guess arbitrum eith with even lower transaction fees and faster confirmations this means hash flow is now live on ethereum polygon bsc and arbitrum i'm sure they're going to as i said last time be deploying to every evm compatible chain it just makes sense at this point in time and all and you know for those who don't know what hash flow is it's basically an exchange where you can uh where it's mev resistant you can trade without slippage it's similar to cowswap uh i i believe so um you know and i think i think ash flow has actually been around a bit longer but uh you know they give you that kind of i guess some cheaper cheaper trades here and better trade with zero slippage and mev resistant which is what we all love to to see here so if you're on arbitrum if arbitrum is your l2 of choice and if you're not just go check out uh uh hash flow with cheaper fees there and if you're on polygon you can check them out there and if you're on bsc you can check it out there uh you know the funny thing about speaking of bsc just quickly it's just amazing how like a year ago bsc was all anyone can talk about and now i haven't heard anyone talk about it at all it just seems like they kind of i don't know they fell into their own little niche where they i think they've still got like a bunch of i guess um uh these kind of like ponzi coins spinning up and things like that but there's no ecosystem there and i remember saying this on the refill that i didn't expect there to be an ecosystem there um you know it's very different to other evm compatible networks especially like layer twos and especially like um the polygon pos chain and that there's an actual ecosystem there there are builders who actually care the chains aren't falling apart and things like that but but yeah anyway a little bit sidetracked there but definitely go check out hash flow on arbitrum so a thread that i wanted to highlight here from pseudo theos is one on dank sharding and cr list which is censorship resistant uh list or censorship resistance list um and and and why they're so groundbreaking so this thread uh from from pseudo theos explains this in in kind of like simple terms and as i've said to you guys i'll be highlighting uh everything got to do with dang sharding because i know that it's still confusing i don't have an expand like i'm five for you yet i don't think this thread isn't explained like i'm five but it breaks it down more than any other kind of like thread that i've seen and is it or any kind of like writing that i've seen on on dang sharding and it's very very uh short like it's not a long thread at all so just wanted to put this on your radar definitely go check it out it will be linked in the youtube description uh below um but i guess like maybe i'll try kind of um breaking this down for you guys and explain like i'm five uh just just really quickly here i mean polly now has put it actually best i think where they said dang sharding turns ethereum into a unified settlement and data availability layer now obviously those terms should be familiar to you because i've talked about the modular ethereum stack before and about how there's three parts to it the data availability layer the settlement consensus layer and the execution layer now with dang sharding it basically turns all of ethereum like even though even the ethereum l1 that we know today into a unified settlement and data availability layer without them being kind of like separate concerns right they're actually unified the concerns are still separated but they're unified and what that means is that you can actually have interoperability between all this sort of stuff between all the l2s because they share the same state and i mean i'm getting very technical now and that's probably not an expand like i'm five but basically i mean this is where people are so excited about it because it gives you that true interoperability between the between the l2s and even in a sharded environment between the l2s as well so go read pseudo theosis thread for a further breakdown on this but i'm going to keep hunting for uh the best expand like i'm five out there for you guys on dang sharding as we progress uh you know over the next few months of course so a new project announced itself today called backdrop and they also announced the funding round a seed round led by uh i guess like seed club ventures here and limniscap with participation from a scalar capital coinbase ventures and a bunch of angels on the right hand side that you can see here now what is backdrop well backdrop helps you discover get notified about and participate in tokenized communities that resonate with who you are basically a dow curation that's a very important i guess platform uh so their public launch is uh that's what they announced today with their initial fundraise and you can find more information about this in uh this is kind of like twitter thread here and of course going to their website and they're also hiring and all that good stuff there but basically basically uh you know they're basically trying to tackle the issue of discoverability so they say in their second tweet here we believe that you shouldn't need to spend all day in six different discords to belong in web three etherscan is great for machines but bad for understanding communities and people community spaces need to be taken native and encourage participation with zero setup where three communities are not just web two communities with a token on top adding a few features to web 2 tool won't leverage the transformative potential of new ways to capture store and govern the value that communities create in web 3 we need to build from the ground up so i mean i've been talking about this before with you guys where i've said that you know you can't just like call yourself web 3 by tacking on a few web 3 features onto a web 2 app and that's what kind of i guess twitter is doing even though i like what they're doing like with adding ethereum addresses nft stuff that doesn't make twitter a web 3 protocol a web 3 kind of like protocol is built from the bottom up with all these things in mind and especially built in a kind of i guess like open decentralized interoperable way and then from there you get to a kind of like true web 3 protocol uh and i actually do like what backdrop says here is that you shouldn't need to spend all day in all these different communities just to find where you belong and i think that's the problem they're tackling because right now if someone new comes into this ecosystem for them to find their community to find uh you know their people will probably take a while because there's a lot of communities out there it's it's it's basically i guess like like the early internet where there was so much going on it was very hard to find your own community and then discoverability tools came online obviously social media was the biggest discoverability tool the algorithms um worked to basically put you where you needed to be for better or worse i mean the algorithms do have their negatives and things like that but we don't really have that for web 3 right now and we definitely don't have it in a web 3 native way so this is pretty cool i'm curious to see where this goes obviously a lot of the web 3 stuff is still pretty early but i think you know once you kind of i guess uh start building this stuff from the ground up it can really lead to some amazing things especially if you leverage other i guess community community projects or i guess like web 3 decentralized project decentralized social media projects like what avair is doing with lens protocol which i think is launching in a few weeks by the way i saw someone from the ava team teasing this on twitter so that's a bit of an alpha leak there uh but yeah i mean as backdrop says this stuff needs to be built from the ground up you cannot just tack this stuff onto web 2 and call yourselves web 3 and you know i actually want to give a quick example of that using twitter again so the reason why twitter can't be considered a web 3 protocol no matter how many web 3 features you add to it is because twitter is still centralized it doesn't have a super open api where you can do anything on it no it's not an open development thing where you can actually contribute to twitter's code and it's you know it's not open source none of that sort of stuff it hasn't been built from the ground up to be an open platform whereas lens protocol ava's attempt is being built like that you know everything is kind of like an nft everything's a token there's uh you know uh interoperability there's portability of your id you can bring your ethereum address to interact with it you don't have to kind of um stay with i guess like uh just what lens protocol provides you with you can go to third parties they're leveraging lens protocol so it's and kind of like i think a simpler example of this is what happens with something like uniswap where the uniswap smart contracts exist but you don't have to use uniswap's front end to access them you can use any front end you can use etherscan to directly access them if you want you can use your own full node to interact with it if you wanted to and do transactions through that that is a web 3 protocol it is not what you know tacking on web 3 features to a web 2 are kind of like existing web 2 servers so cool to see this from backdrop i guess congrats to them on the raise and if you're interested in learning more definitely check this out it'll be linked in the youtube description all right so finally here we have a brand new show from bankless coming out called green pill this show is going to be hosted by gitcoin founder kevin owocke uh and this will be exploring regenerative regenerative crypto economics and public goods with the brightest minds in the space now you guys know that i'm a big proponent for regenerative crypto economics or being a regen instead of a degen basically what this means is that you harness the degeneracy within crypto or at least kind of like a lot of the the money within crypto for regenerative purposes such as public goods funding now obviously gitcoin is all about this public goods funding is their bread and butter and they've been doing a lot of work in this area and this is just another layer on top of that where they're going to be interviewing the coolest people in this space in this space kevin's great obviously he's been at this for quite a while and we're going to be able to kind of learn much more about this so i'm super excited for this the first episode is actually now live on youtube so you can go check that out it'll be linked to the youtube description but this is just another show from bankless i mean these guys are pumping out so much content i can't even keep up with it anymore like i i mean obviously i do a daily youtube show but these guys are doing like interviews and newsletters and they have the bankless down all these other stuff going on it's just crazy i mean i i love bankless i respect them i respect the brand i know some people may find them kind of like cringy or may find it um you know a bit culty but guys like i mean bankless is like a huge thing right like it's as i said they've got a dow they have all this stuff going on it's kind of like hard for it not to turn into a little bit of a kind of like hardcore community i wouldn't even call it a cult it's more of like a hardcore community that really really care about the uh i guess like values and ethos of decentralization crypto you know stuff like regenerative economics and all that sort of stuff um and once a community gets to a certain size as well it just becomes very hard to kind of i guess like pin down uh i guess like a centralized component of it you can't just say that because one small group of that community is um is basically kind of like doing things you may not agree with that it applies to the rest of the community and this just happens in every single community out there you know the funny thing is is that some people give the daily gueye shit for for being a small community and you know what i love our small community it means we we get a lot of like cool conversations happening in the discord channel we get to discuss a lot of really cool things um there's not just kind of like a lot of you know there's no crap there's no drama it's just uh it's just like a lot of great conversation so i'm happy for that but you know maybe the daily way community grows really big too and then we end up having uh you know uh i guess like the problems that big communities have but i don't think so i think uh we we do a really good job of balancing i guess like growing a community but also staying true to our roots and the community like for me i'm happy with how it's been growing i don't need it to grow like super super quickly and all that sort of stuff for i guess like me to feel like i'm doing what i should be doing with spreading the message about ethereum and educating about ethereum but we you know it's not just me right we have other kind of like um people out there growing communities we have obviously bankless and there's a bunch of others out there and it's a diversity of of community it's not just like one centralized thing which is really awesome um but i think on that note that's gonna be it for today so thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet get the video thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the

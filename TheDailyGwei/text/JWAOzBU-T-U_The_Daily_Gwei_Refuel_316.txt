 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the deadly way refuel where we kept the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host anthony sassano. Today is the 16th of february 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So i'll put out a tweet today Basically saying honestly the more bad takes I read about crypto the more convinced I become that people are mostly anti-crypto Because they didn't get rich from it Imagine missing out on the greatest wealth transfer in history because you thought it was a scam. It's got a sting Now there were a few people kind of like replying to this saying, you know It's not too late for them to get involved. They of course can you know make investments and if they make some good investments They can make some money here and then sometimes they can even make like 100 x the money or something like that, right? Like a lot of those opportunities still exist as i've discussed before but I think What ends up happening is that if you miss out on something for so long and it keeps succeeding without you You grow to resent that thing you grow to hate that thing and i've noticed this a lot with the anti-crypto people is that they over the years they've kind of like celebrated whenever the market's being bearish whenever like the the Price came crashing down again and everything kind of like went went very bearish for it for a while And then it always roars back now imagine you've been a bitcoin bear since I don't know like the early 2010s there are a few people like that out there since like 2012 2013 you've seen the big you know 2014 crash of course of bitcoin you then saw the 2018 crash uh, sorry, and then bitcoin rebounded back from that and you saw the the amazing 2017 run then You saw it crash again and then you saw it run again and every time it just bounced back stronger And for you you've just been out of position at that point because you've been hating on it You've been saying no this is all a scam. It's going to zero blah blah and you you just really do grow to resent uh, you know, I guess crypto generally especially when you see uh, like people a lot of people making money off things like nfts I think this is where a lot of the nft hate comes from as well There's also a lot of kind of like divide right now Um in in just general society the middle class seems to be disappearing So I kind of like get that plays, you know all plays into it But it's just kind of like this this thing that happens where people kind of like they know that they probably should get involved You know and stop missing out on on what's going on, but they've hated it for so long It's kind of like a sunk cost fallacy as well where they're kind of like, okay Well, you know, I can't stop hating it now. All right, you know, I can't get involved now I can't get involved now. It doesn't matter like I I can't make the money, you know, I can't I can't get rich of it anymore So i'm just going to keep hating it and I see this play out so so much from from from many many different people Especially from the ones who have really really bad takes on on crypto now not to say that bad takes On crypto are limited to these people. There's plenty of people in crypto that have really bad takes. I mean I discussed lin olden's bad take on proof of stake just yesterday, but I think generally this same repa the same pattern just keeps repeating and you know to be fair I've had this kind of like thing play out for myself and i'm sure some of you have as well where It's kind of like this weird thing. I i'm sure there's a name for it But I just don't know what it is where you see something and you've just kind of like missed out on investing in it And then you turn to like irrationally disliking it because of that you're you know You you kind of like miss out on buying into it even though You you know you you were going to buy into it and then like all your friends are making money on it sort of Things so or not just making money on it, but just like seeing some sort of success from it I'm sure there's a name for this. I'm just not I I just don't know what it is right now But yeah I just kind of like keep seeing this pattern play out and repeat itself over and over again Whenever I read these bad takes so I felt like it was worth discussing today Um and on a kind of like related note to this as well I would say that The anti-crypto stuff comes from like not just the fact that they've missed out but also from a lack of understanding as i've discussed before Most people see the crypto industry as just the what the headlines show them the mainstream media headlines, which are obviously horrible, right? Like there's the headlines really only talk about two things mainly the scams Um rug pulls and hacks which I put into like one category And the people making a lot of money from it right the people making their overnight riches Now if that's all you see about crypto if you don't know you don't see anything about the tech You don't see anything about the you the actual use cases. You don't see anyone getting actual value out of it all you see is like opposite ends of the kind of like Oh, sorry the extreme ends of the spectrum Then of course you're going to have like a kind of limited and warped view Now where that kind of like view starts to I guess for me Uh interfere with someone's kind of like, uh a way to kind of rationally debate something is when they're opining on something and we've seen this player with the nft ecosystem where a lot of people were basically give like Really strong opinions about nfts and they have absolutely no idea what they're talking about A lot of them will say oh, you know nfts are killing the environment When in reality the ethereum network is going to produce a block regardless of what's in it So the environmental impact is pretty much going to be the same if there's zero nfts in a block or if there's kind of like You know if the whole blocks are nfts uh, and it's and and really there's uh, I mean you could say that kind of like uh as um Activity picks up on on ethereum the eith prize goes up and that leads to more miners coming online Which which leads to a larger kind of like economic, uh environmental footprint But I mean if eith gets value from a lot of different things not just nfts and and you'd be hard pressed to map Its value directly back to nfts. I think it's a it's a kind of like holistic thing Um, so that's just kind of like one of the big Misunderstandings there but people will keep repeating that they'll keep saying that they don't even care that it's wrong because that's just what um You know, they're sticking with they're kind of like, um built a lot, uh, you know built up this kind of uh image or mental model with like, you know, I I have to hate nfts because they're bad for the environment and anything that proves them wrong on that They just don't want to hear about so i'm sure you guys have seen this plenty of times Uh, whether it's been in the nft ecosystem or just crypto more generally So I figured it was worth bringing up today, but I think i'm not gonna ramble too much on about that Uh, you know, I I think that as we kind of progress through the adoption cycle of crypto A lot of this stuff's just going to be inconsequential. I mean it already is inconsequential These people don't really have any bearing on what crypto if crypto is going to succeed or not as i've mentioned before on the refuel The the fact that that something has haters is you know, and that thing is still growing is actually generally a good thing for the thing Right, if it's still growing if all the metrics are trending up and to the right then the hate doesn't matter The hate just acts as free marketing which is exactly what we see play out with with nfts a lot of the time But also with crypto more generally, uh, so yeah good thing to kind of like keep in mind and keep an eye on that's for sure All right. So today there was this research paper posted by jia sun li here Uh where he basically described it in a tweet basically saying how effective is ethereum 2.0 slashing mechanism? More than 75 of violations failed to be detected by whistleblowers Whistleblowers and thus were not slashed and he links to the paper here, which you can go check out now This paper is so deeply flawed. I'm surprised that it was published. It's that bad guys and i'll explain to you why it's bad It's bad because they used one third party source For the basis of the entire paper. So in the paper you'll be able to see like if you go if I open the pdf In my web browser here. It should load up. Uh, you can scroll to kind of like the bottom pages and they have links to all of The validators and attestations and voting and all that sort of stuff that's that's going on here and all the data that they use to base Their their research on but all of that data came from one source, which was the beacon chain Uh, I guess like ch a.io website. Sorry.in website Which uh, you know provides a lot of different kind of like metrics around the beacon chain and statistics around the beacon chain But it turns out there was a bug in how they were kind of reporting certain things And that bug meant that this research paper was just completely wrong So not only did the authors not actually use uh multiple third-party sources They didn't even use an independent source, which they could have they could have spun up their own Beacon node and and done this and check the data for themselves But they decided to base an entire paper on this publish the paper and then spread unintentionally probably fud about ethereum 2.0 slashing mechanism now if you go to this tweet in this thread You'll be able to see basically all the replies from a bunch of uh, some of the a bunch of eth2 client developers and researchers Paul Horner is in here from the lighthouse team Raoul from the prylabs team uh line here from uh from uh From uh chain safe for a lodestar. That's that's right. Buddha even replied from the beacon chain kind of like team here There's a bunch of other people replying in here. I'm pretty sure uh, uh, where was it? I'm pretty sure someone else replied Yeah, sorry adrian sutton here from The consensus protocol engineer, uh, sorry consensus protocol team put together a thread basically saying, you know Why this was wrong essentially so you can read this thread from the consensus protocol team So basically saying, you know why this was wrong essentially so you can read this thread for a deeper breakdown here but what I actually another thing that I kind of like wanted to mention here was that this report was quote tweeted by a bunch of different people, uh, and I I believe that Kevin one of the I think is the co-founder one of the co-founders of avalanche Uh actually retweeted this uh with a quote tweet saying Uh interesting paper or something like that now obviously was trying to spread fud Uh about ethereum at least that's how I took it and then lin alden re re uh retweeted kevin's tweet, so she This is just classic. This is kind of like following on what I said yesterday. She's not interested in the truth about proof of stake, right She's not interested in the truth about uh, kind of like how it works She's not interested in learning more about it All she's interested in doing is pushing a narrative and that's what a lot of people do They'll latch onto anything no matter if it's true or not to push the narrative Which is the ultimate irony for bitcoin is because bitcoin has always chant verify don't trust, you know verify the information for yourself Don't trust third-party sources. Well, here's a third-party source that didn't even do a research paper properly and they're trusting that person in order to give them kind of like that context so I just This is just like so insane to me that people are so quick and so, you know So badly want to fud ethereum that they'll just jump on anything and you can see in some of the quote tweets Yeah, I mean, this is an avalanche person right here. Uh, obviously, I mean, that's funny. They follow me Oh, I say it's an avalanche person because the avalanche people have these like red up Up pointing red triangle in their names, but they've kind of got like this. Oh, you know, oh shit like gif from From the office here, uh, and then you can kind of like scroll down look at some of the other quote tweets I mean this one here saying that uh I'm pressing this this um, this silly picture of italic and kind of like uh paying out on ethereum Just it's I mean the bitcoin is saving account saying there is no second but like this is stupid, right? But this is what people latch onto and this is what actually is super frustrating for me as an educator Is the fact that people will literally latch onto fake information fake news so to speak to push their own agenda And this doesn't just happen in crypto it happens everywhere But as an educator, it's especially frustrating But I mean I encourage you to uh, go check out the thread from from adrian sutton Which I'll link in the youtube description. I do think reading the paper is a waste of time considering the data is not correct It doesn't really give you any information or anything because of that they base their entire argument on this incorrect data and basically what their argument was was that um this slasher which is a uh, uh kind of like I guess so How can I break this down really simply validators and I guess like nodes within the beacon chain don't uh slash by default They have to kind of like be set up to slash and you can opt into it It requires a bit more hardware to do this, right? It's a bit more demanding on your hardware to do this, but you opt into it and then you can be a slasher And it's kind of like an automated process and that's how people are slashed in e2 for doing bad things um, but this paper basically said that 75 percent of all uh, All bad things that happen weren't slashed which is which is incorrect based on the data that was dug out by the e2 Client developers and researchers are given that there was a bug on on beacon chain that was showing the incorrect data here. So Uh, but the beacon chain website not the actual beacon chain Um, but yeah, definitely go read adrian's tweet thread. I wouldn't bother reading the paper I mean you can you don't listen to me you can read it if you want But I just felt it was a waste of time given that the data was that was wrong here So so yeah, anyway, go check that out. If you haven't yet it'll be linked in the youtube description All right, so the ultrasound money account put out an interesting tweet today where they said, um, ms tr which is uh, uh micro strategy, which is uh, what's his name? Um, How do I how do I go blank on his name right when I need it? Oh, michael sailor It's michael sailor's company, um that he buys bitcoin through right so they're buying 200 million dollars of btc a month on average so far But then you look at ethereum right and you look at kind of like how much uh, I guess like eth is being bought A month by a single entity and the biggest buyer of eath right now is the ethereum network itself because the ethereum network itself Is technically buying a billion dollars worth of eath and burning it every month, right? Because I mean, yes, it's not directly going out to the market and buying and buying um Um eath but what it is doing is the ethereum network is selling block space for eath So to buy ethereum's goods the ethereum network's good, which is block space. You have to pay it using eath So technically the ethereum network is kind of like doing a trade here with Between block space and eath and that's where you get that obviously Most of that gets burst 70 to 80 percent of it gets burned And that's where you get what I titled today's newsletter. Um as uh is the perpetual buyer So that's ethereum every 13 or so seconds. So every ethereum block the ethereum network will purchase and burn a ton of Eathing fees and that'll add up really really quickly over time. I mean at this point We've burned over five billion dollars worth of eath which is almost two million eath since eip 1 559 went live in only august of last Year and that's going to continue in perpetuity that is never stopping every single block for as long as the ethereum network lives It will burn eath now, of course like there is a there is the smallest chance that for some reason in the future The uh community comes together and says, okay Well, maybe we don't want uh eath to be burned anymore and they could change it right like anything can be changed at the protocol Level if the humans agree to do that, but uh, there's no indication of that happening I don't see any reason for that to happen. Um, uh, you know at least for the foreseeable future So yeah ethereum becomes a perpetual a perpetual buyer of eath and this obviously has like giant ramifications for I guess, um, you know eath as an asset Ethereum the network and just like demand supply dynamics for eath in general But what I really like about this is that no matter what ethereum the ethereum itself is the buyer of last resort for its own Asset even if the demand for eath from every other source was zero the ethereum network would still buy and burn eath because You don't just do eath related things on the ethereum network. You do a ton of different things you do nft stuff You do dow stuff you do uh, I'm kind of like, um, uh, web3 stuff, right? You register an ens name all that kind of stuff That all requires you to make a transaction which requires you to burn eath because uh, you can't get around that The ethereum network needs to burn eath as part of the base fee that is part of the eip1559 mechanism So from that perspective, it's just actually like really really cool to think about right that we have like a perpetual buy in the network itself And we don't actually rely on outside buys to keep the demand up for it for for um for eath as an asset as long As the ethereum network has demand eath the asset has demand as well which leads me to my final point which is that I've always had the belief that eath is a better asset than things like bitcoin because of its utility and its utility comes from the network So that's why I thought i've always had the thesis that as the ethereum network grows as its utility grows as more and more people get Like value out of ethereum and as eath captures that value because it obviously has to capture it It can't just be the network I'm getting all the usage and then the token not capturing any of it because it doesn't have any way to capture it Whereas eath obviously has a lot of ways the burn staking collateral all that sort of stuff That the thesis was is that as the ethereum network grows the eath price should grow with it Based on that fundamental demand not just not based on any esoteric things not based on means or narrative Narratives based on actual fundamental demand for the asset from the network itself, which is exactly what we're seeing play out So this is what keeps me the most bullish on eath of the long term really is I mean the two the two things that I think Are the most bullish for eath as an asset Is the burn mechanism, uh and and kind of like, uh, you know, the amount of eath being burned and uh staking those two things I mean we could get rid of everything else and those two things would still make eath one of the best assets on the planet But we do have everything else still right we have eath is used as money. It's used as store of value It's used as defy collateral like there's so many use cases for eath It's just like how can you be bearish on eath, right? I've said this a million times But yeah, I just wanted to kind of cover that interesting tweet here Um, but that's it for that because I got 15 minutes left and i've got a bunch to get through So alex vanderson has put together a nice thread with a bunch of graphics around the ens system So you can see here alex says ens is a complex system made up of multiple contracts Ens is a complex system made up of multiple contracts. He has found 16 so far This ensures we can freeze some parts and update others limiting the scope of the damage a single error can do The downside is that it's very hard for one person to get a grasp of the hole Until now and until now meaning that he's put together a thread going over each part of the ens system Breaking it down showing pretty graphics for it and everything like that So whether you're a developer or otherwise and you want to kind of like really get into the nitty-gritty of how ens works And how all the pieces come together. You should definitely check out this thread from alex It was very interesting a very interesting read he goes into detail about this and if you're wondering who alex vanderson is Um, he is an eth og he's been around since basically day one And he's also the co-founder of ens. So he would know a thing or two about the system here. So, um, definitely, uh, Go check this thread out from him because you know He knows what he's talking about and there's a lot of really great information that can be had from this thread All right So another thread from polly now today discussing dy dx is uh kind of like fee revenue and how much fees they are paying And just layer twos in general so polly now starts the tweet by saying dy dx did 1.15 million transactions paying 45 000 in gas fees that's 0.04 cents per transaction dy dx transactions are highly complex estimated estimated at 300 000 to 400 000 gas overall dy dx did four times if you're a main net in terms of transactions But this is just the beginning fees will keep dropping as activity increases and then polly now does one of their classic threads Which you should give a read to below now what I wanted to kind of like discuss here is the fact that I showed you this the website the other day or that david mihal created where he's basically tracking how much layer twos are paying to L1 for security The efficiency here is insane right that that truly I mean 45 000 in gas fees to settle 1.15 million transactions per transaction 45 million transactions doing four times the amount of ethereum main net in just one app specific roll up is Insanity, right? I mean It's just crazy. Like you can even see in the polly next week He says they say I estimate that dy dx earned three million dollars in trading fees at least in the last 24 hours And only 1.5 percent of that was was needed to pay ethereum for security and settlement When you're running costs are this low, right when you can literally pay one to two percent As settlement fee and and as kind of like posting your data and things like that to layer one ethereum Then it is an absolute no-brainer to just spin a roll up up because doing this as a layer one You would need to pay out block subsidy block rewards to Validators in order to secure the network and to come to consensus on things and to be your sediment layer Uh for your kind of like app That's why i've always been bearish on sovereign app specific chains that aren't they don't share security and stuff like that I've just been super bearish on that because it's just economically, uh wasteful It's just you're bleeding so much value Like imagine if dy dx was its own layer one instead of its own roll up and it's still at its dy dx token Now let's say that the token actually had to pay out to the layer one validators because let's imagine it was a proof of stake Network in order to secure the network. Let's say inflation was five percent That's five percent of whatever the dy dx market cap is, you know being inflated a year just to pay the validators And that's not including the liquidity mining that dy dx is doing the investor tokens all that all sort of stuff coming out But this is going to you know, uh to parties that That need to be paid in order to secure the network now as a layer two and also they have to worry about consensus and and kind of like keeping a layer one network up and All that sort of stuff which Is not something that app developers should have to worry about the app developers should be able to just worry about their app and making It the best possible thing they can make it and not have to worry about the the infrastructure behind it Right, or at least kind of like the layer one infrastructure Uh now with the layer two the costs come down considerably. They only need to pay uh ethereum for like, uh, You know kind of like pay posting their batches there and posting their Their call data and things like that Which is considerably cheaper and they pay they obviously pass those costs onto the users because on dy dx It's free to trade because they make it in trading fees instead of charging you gas fees to trade on there So I mean I recommend going giving this thread from polina read but it just again It speaks to to the fact that the modular blockchain thesis and the modular blockchain design is vastly superior to the monolithic Design in pretty much every way possible But I think cost is one of the biggest kind of like reasons why it's superior And and that's what makes me most bullish on I guess like the modular design in general All right So I think I uh spoke about this last week with the coinbase wallet extension supporting polygon pos deck swaps here Which you can see a little gif of but I wanted to hide that. Uh, I guess like um Coinbase I guess like highlighting this and actually advertising it through their channels. I I feel is like really bullish, right? I really like this because of the fact that I know Coinbase has been dragging their feet on ethereum scalability integrations and layer two integrations But at least once they do it, they're promoting it at least one, you know Once they do it, they're actually tangible about it instead of just like doing it and kind of like leaving people to discover that themselves So I really like that. Um, I wish these exchanges will do more marketing around this I know it's in not in some of the the you know Some of the exchanges best interest to do this and I know that people are just going to find their way to the layer twos anyway but I mean Could you imagine like a coinbase doing a concerted effort around getting people to go onto layer twos instead of ethereum layer one? imagine coinbase doing a thing where they're like Hey, would you like to transfer to ethereum layer one or one of these layer twos and explain the difference to users about them saying? You can do what you can do on ethereum, but it's cost you considerably less and it's just you know It shares the security of ethereum I think that would go a long way to educating people as well and I hope just coinbase that can do this is pretty much any On off-ramp to to layer twos that can do this and I hope to see more of it going forward. That's for sure All right Speaking of layer twos optimism put out a post today breaking down how they've been able to lower gas fees on the optimism network Over the last few months now, obviously I've covered these I guess like 30% reductions In gas fees whenever they've happened and if you but if you want a more technical breakdown You should definitely go check out this blog post from optimism. I'm not going to summarize it for you I'm not I'm not going to read it out for you. Definitely go check it out It'll be linked in the youtube description, but I want to see more of this I love this sort of stuff like especially the more technical stuff because it's all well and good for Them to announce these things and you know end users getting benefits out of it, which is obviously the main point But like me as someone who wants to dive deeper I always kind of like wonder like what how do they actually achieve this like what goes on under? Goes on under the hood and yes, you know There's probably like one percent of the people who actually use ethereum and use optimism that will read this blog post But I don't think that matters I think that's the one percent of people who are actually interested in it and actually interested in understanding it and could actually probably Help like a lot of developers are going to read this and be like, oh, that's how they did it. That's really cool I could integrate that with my own kind of like contract or my own code sort of thing. So I think it's um, It's very important to kind of I guess like have these blog posts available for people Especially the more technical people just so they can learn from from the experts so to speak All right a new protocol launched on ethereum mainnet today called zero x splits So zero x splits is the protocol for trustless composable gas efficient splits It's non-upgradable completely free to use and entirely on chain and today it's live on ethereum now you'll have Seen or heard me talk about splits as a concept before uh, we've got to do with the mirror platform I think I spoke about this a few months ago But basically what a split allows you to do and this is this actually happened with the nfts as well that we did for The daily way basically there was a split contract put in place on mirror where we said, okay X amount is going to kidda for his work x amount is going to me and then that Those funds I took from from kind of like myself and I put them in Into the uh, the vesting contract for the e2, um core devs, right? uh, but with with with um, you know zero x splits we can kind of like expand on that and kind of like Make it composable and go even further with it where you you can do splits for anything really? I mean I suggest reading their blog post to kind of like get a get a breakdown of this and kind of like get a breakdown of Why this is really great infrastructure, but you can see here like a visualization of it, right? There's a split this split kind of like pays out to alice and bob But then it also pays out to another split which you can pay out to more people So there's kind of like, you know infinite loops you can do here with splits you can split uh, uh different things like um, Not just kind of like eic 20 tokens, but you could do like nft stuff You could do any kind of like a value but whether that's like ethe 20 tokens nfts or anything like that So i'm really excited about this protocol. I I think it's very interesting I think it's it definitely is a core primitive and core infrastructure It may seem like something that's that's kind of like simple but like that's kind of like a core infrastructure Simple but like that's the point right supposed to be simple Uh, a simple splits protocol for anyone to be able to use that's on you know on a theorem Very very easy to use and people can get a lot of value out of it's sort of like um, the nurses safe multi-sig It's a very kind of like simple thing, right? It's a multi-sig wallet, but it has a lot of features on it It has a lot of different things you can do with it a lot of people use it There's over 100 billion dollars with the value in there because it just provides a simple effective service and that's all you need Sometimes you don't need all these fancy bells and whistles everywhere. Just like a multi-sig is fine I know nurses safe integrates with a bunch of different things, but that came later I think the multi-sig on its own is is just an amazing product, you know itself It doesn't even need all the other features But I think that's what zero explicit is going to do it They're going to be a similar thing where it's just core infrastructure that everyone can use and then it's very easy to use as well So James while here from fire eyes now announced a new thing called the wildfire Dow So what the wildfire Dow is is that it connects the theorem community members to tackle token design? governance and coordination within specific sectors of web 3 So if you're interested in getting involved in any of that sort of stuff wildfire Dow may be for you now James It has been a long term or long time kind of like a Dow person He is part of a group that consists of people like Cooper Turley here Lucas from Bankless Callum here from from fire eyes as well that have been doing a lot of different governance related things They've helped ENS out before they've helped get coin out They've helped a bunch of other projects out as well and they've just been you know Fully emerged within the Dow ecosystem for a very long time. So I'm bullish on these guys I'm bullish on this team and bullish on what wildfire wants to do Like you can see here James saying they're gonna focus on four key sectors Which is defy public goods the creator economy and infrastructure all with tokenized incentives to contribute So if you're looking for something to do, maybe even part-time or casually within the crypto ecosystem This is probably for you to be honest I mean this is going to cover a wide range of different use cases gonna cover not only web3 stuff But defy stuff and nfts and just other dow's there's so much going on here I actually think this is probably as even as a newer person Probably the best way to learn about the ecosystem in general, especially the etherium ecosystem so I mean, you know, you can read about it here and you can You can kind of like join the discord channel as well to get more involved But I think you know if I if I was to recommend anything today for for a new person to get involved with the etherium Ecosystem this would probably it at this at this point now that I've now that I have like a little bit of a think about It because there's a million different rabbit holes you can fall down But you really want to start like the high level you want to start with kind of like like-minded people and people that are kind Of been involved with this sort of stuff for a while And you want to have them guide you into the right places instead of falling down the big boy rabbit hole You never want to go down that rabbit hole. You definitely want to go down this one So definitely check it out join the discord channel and I'm sure someone will be able to help you in there if you want to get on boarded Alright, so nifty island is very close to releasing their closed alpha and they've been teasing a lot of things lately such as kind Of like the building system the characters how the nft's are gonna be able to integrate and transform I'm super super excited for nifty island. Like I love that. I you know, I've still got my palm. I've still got my pistols I want to be able to kind of like put them on my island and build everything and stuff like that And you know, you can see this teaser video here of them kind of like putting together a house and building things You know I the reason why I mean one of the reasons why I'm so excited about this is because I used to be really big into builder games, especially Minecraft back in the day. This is a long time ago. Like I was 18, huh? I was actually playing Minecraft instead of studying for my year 12 exams, but which were the most important exams in hindsight Not really, but at the time they were the most important exams But I just I love building things like I love building things from nothing building it up and I think for Minecraft for me It was that I didn't really have permanence like there were online stuff you could do and things like that But it all felt kind of felt like okay. Well, and this is temporary This isn't gonna last, you know for many many years not gonna last forever Whereas with an nft based game or something like nifty island what they're trying to do With the metaverse is they're actually trying to make things last for a very long time They're trying to build permanence and that's what I've always wanted in a game is permanent It's always turned me off a lot of these online games Is that it feels like you play them for a little while and then they just kind of like get stale and get old And and kind of the company gives up on them I mean world of Warcraft is an example of one that lasted a very long time But even that's kind of like come to its its end I mean they had to relaunch the the game from from zero because so many people wanted to play Classic world of Warcraft again rather than the modern version which is called retail and I actually think they're at the point now where they're probably Going to bring out like world of Warcraft 2 or something because retail has gotten so stale The classic which is the reboot that they did is progressing but even that like It just gets to a point where things get stale and and there's really no permanence there because the centralized company you can't take your Assets with you can't put them in other games. It's just like all on one centralized server So I think from that perspective, that's why I'm one of the main reasons. I'm excited about nifty island So I'm curious to see how this closed alpha goes and hopefully I can be involved with this I mean, I've got a palm I'm gonna assume I'm gonna get an invite to this I'm gonna be able to enter into the closed alpha and if I am I'll play around with it I'll let you guys know what I think about it in a discord channel So definitely join that if you haven't yet to get my thoughts there, but I think that's gonna be it for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel If you haven't yet give the video a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the discord channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow Thanks, everyone

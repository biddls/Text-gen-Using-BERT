 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily gray refuel where we kept the latest news in the theorem ecosystem I'm your host Anthony sasana. It's 8th of February 2022. All right, everyone. Let's get into it So you guys know by now about these two popular misconceptions or when it comes to the merge and I you know I just put this sweet up before so Gonna just kind of rehash this a little bit today for possibly any new kind of like viewers or listeners out there But I basically put out this tweet where I said there's currently two popular misconceptions surrounding a theorem is transition to prove proof of stake aka the merge Number one is all staked eight is unlocking at the time of the merge and number two is the merge lowers gas fees on layer One both of these narratives are completely false now Long time daily way refuel kind of listeners and watchers will know exactly what I'm talking about here but just a quick refresh for people who don't the Withdrawals for the staked eighth on the beacon chain aren't actually being enabled until see at least six months after the merge So if the merge happens in June you can expect to see the withdrawals enabled November December the earliest They could even push into next year. It just depends on a bunch of different things You know got to do with the core dev process and the IP process from there and the second thing here is the That the merge lowers gas phase on layer one as we all know if we know about the modular theorem scaling roadmap The merge does not lower gas fees on layer one the the it has nothing to do with gas phase at all actually, right? Because proof of work proof of stake. It doesn't matter. These are consensus mechanisms They don't really have anything to do with with kind of like lowering fees or anything like that Despite what you have may have read so yeah, the merge is not lowering gas fees on layer one now I want to talk about more more about point number one because there's a lot of confusion around this point, right? So right now let's let's take it take a step back all the way back to kind of like the the bare minimum The bare minimum information you need here So right now there is what eight or nine million each state I can't remember the exact number right now But there's something like that state on the beacon chain now currently that is a one-way bridge where you stake your eighth right the eighth Gets put into what's called the deposit contract on the etherium one side or the execution layer side as we're calling it and then it basically transfers that across to No I guess like burns it on the eighth one side and then Issues you that eighth on the the beacon chain side and then you can stake Oh if you want to stake on your own it's a 32 week minimum if you stay through someone else then like a third party They will put that eat into The deposit contract because that's the only way you can enter staking in every single validator that gets spun up has to have 32 Eats at least associated with it doesn't matter if you're staking with the exchange service provider on your own. It's the same thing It's just that the way service providers and exchanges do it is that they'll allow you to stake less But they pull it together right as a staking pool and they still put that 32 week per validator in To get that spun up there. So that's that's kind of like how you get into staking now. There's On top of that and kind of like associated with that is what's called the deposit queue And there's also they're going to be the withdrawal queue But that's not currently in place because that only comes when we have withdrawals So the deposit queue essentially is a maximum amount of kind of like a thought or guess like Validators that can be spun up a day last time I checked it's around 30,000 eighth that can actually be deposited every 24 hours from the deposit contract into the beacon chain Essentially the process I should say is the better word there. So there is a limit you can't it's not like you could stake A million eighth today and then be wearing rewards in that million eighth like right away. No, this doesn't work like that It's limited to about 30,000 eighth per day. Now. The same is true for the future withdrawal queue. So For example, obviously when withdrawals are enabled all of that eighth is eligible to be unlocked And some of it will be unlocked and unstaked and and kind of like withdrawn and maybe sold on an exchange But again only 30,000 eighth per day and I actually have to double check on this Because I think the deposit and withdrawal queues are actually shared But I have to double check on this. I'm not I'm not 100% sure but I guess my main point Is that there's still a limit here? It's not like that eight or nine million eight is probably gonna be more by that point but it's not like it can actually just be withdrawn all at once and then Sold on an exchange or whatever and we have like a massive dump. That's not gonna happen And the reason there's that queue is for security reasons Like you can imagine How disastrous it would be if all the eighth or even like a large majority the eighth was able to be withdrawn at once Those validators go offline the chain would basically halt if enough went offline so that that's done for security reasons Same with kind of like the deposit contract that you have to actually verify you have to let blocks kind of like confirm over time I meant to verify that the everything's everything's working smoothly. So there are limits in place So even if the state eighth was unlocking at the time of the merge It would still be the same situation where there's a limit to how much it can actually be withdrawn each day And thus there's a limit to how much how much can actually be sold on the market each day So I think that a lot of people don't understand this and a lot of people think that it's a bear case saying Oh, yeah We're gonna have like a massive run up to the merge because a narrative and then as soon as the merge happens It's gonna dump really hard because all these eights gonna hit the market when that is just not true at all This isn't even a matter of opinion. It's a matter of fact So I think that understanding those dynamics as I was just planning as I was talking about yesterday with regards to The you know proof of stake and the merge and how that's extremely bullish faith that plays into it as well So that's that's that's that's point number one And then I briefly mentioned point number two before about the merge not lowering gas fees. This is a very perverse narrative I think this is way more damaging than than the first narrative I think this one's going to persist and until the merge and then you know people are gonna realize okay Well the merge you didn't lower gas fees What is this and they're gonna think that it's a scam or think that like they were promising that they weren't? It's it's gonna be annoying to deal with I don't think it's you know Existential or like a bear case for a theorem or anything like that But it's gonna be a bit annoying to deal with it's gonna be kind of like dealing with people who thought yeah He won five five nine would lower gas fees even though I personally didn't see a single person ever say that the IP one five five Nine would lower gas fees and anyone who did say that was part of the mine part of the minority that it wasn't the consensus opinion none of the serious researchers developers educators in this space ever ever claimed that 1559 would lower gas fees at least from what I saw and that's because we all knew that it wouldn't we all knew that the Best thing it would do would be smooth out transaction fees which could lead to a slight decrease in gas fees Which I think ended up being around six or seven percent for coinbase for example not not network wide But I think coinbase ended up saving six to seven percent because they had better Better I guess transaction certainty around getting their transactions in again their withdrawals processed and things like that But but generally yeah, what wasn't a kind of like a block size increase or anything like that? I mean, okay, well technically it was but like we're only using half the block I'm not gonna get into the mechanics of it But I think that that narrative still persists to this day or people say oh we will promise lower gas fees with one five five Nine it didn't happen I was like no you weren't and that's why I keep hammering on about the merge not lowering gas phases because no one's promising that No one serious is promising that the you know who's promising that the bloody clickbait youtubers They're just spreading absolute crappy information all the time that really pisses me off because you know I try to like fight back against this But obviously the the viewership on the daily way is much lower because I don't use clickbait and things like that And then you have these massive accounts saying stuff like if to or the merge is gonna lower gas fee blah blah When in reality you already can have cheap fees today go to a layer two there you go They're already live today and the kind of like a theorem Core protocol our roadmap is in is being kind of like architected to make L twos better as we all know so so yeah I just wanted to kind of like rehash a bit on those misconceptions there I hope that you guys keep educating on this as well if you ever see someone kind of like bring up these these bad narratives And you feel like correcting them Please do so because every little bit helps even if you you know if you're a small account on Twitter Even if you've only got like a hundred followers It doesn't matter what matters is if we all work together, and we all kind of like put this message out there We can counteract the bad information yes, it may feel like you know we're not making progress But I think we are like every single person that we're able to educate is still progress even if it's slower Then what other people kind of like spread its progress, so I hope you guys kind of like Stick to doing that there, but anyway moving on to the next bit of news from last 24 hours Was that KPMG Canada announced that they have allocate that they have completed an allocation of crypto assets to their corporate treasury and therefore? It is the firm's first of its kind investment into the crypto asset class this includes BTC and ETH tokens and carbon offsets to maintain a net zero carbon transaction. This is pretty cool I mean KPMG is an absolutely massive kind of like financial services firm Think their revenue. I was looking it up before is like 30 billion dollars worldwide Which is which is obviously not nothing to scoff out there, and they are a company that have put ETH on their kind of like balance sheet here and BTC of course which is which is huge right we saw a lot of this Obviously during 2020 and and somewhat in 2021 this with BTC But as I said to you guys back then we would be seeing ETH on these balance sheets right alongside BTC And we have been lately and it just makes sense I mean BTC and ETH are the two blue chips There's nothing that even comes close to the same legitimacy and the same kind of like I Guess like ecosystems that BTC and ETH have I know you guys obviously know that I'm not really bullish on on Bitcoin as kind of Like an ecosystem, but I can't deny that it's a large ecosystem You know just because I am not bullish on doesn't mean that other people aren't you know so and obviously It's still the biggest crypto cryptocurrency It's still the one that a lot of the normies as they call them love because they just don't they don't understand the intricacies Of it they just want an asset that they can hold and goes up over time. That's it right so um But I think with ETH there's a there's a lot more that can be done here obviously With staking and stuff like that the staking products can be offered to clients and and things like that So there's there's more to it than then just with BTC, and I guess I thought that's what gets me excited about ETH But yeah very very cool to see just such a large kind of like company putting ETH on their balance sheet that I Guess further signals to other companies that they you know it's safe to do so like obviously I think sailor kick-started it originally And he signaled to a lot of other companies and corporates and enterprises that it was safe to put BTC on your balance sheet Or it was like the cool thing to do. I think the same is true for ETH You know I think you know it hasn't materialized as quickly as I thought it would and I kind of like Underestimated how slow corporates and enterprises move even though I shouldn't know because I've worked to one before I know how slow they move But I think they're a lot of the time many of them are chasers So what will happen is they'll feel comfortable doing it when the prices are going up But they'll they won't feel comfortable doing it when the price is going down And you may think that this is what noobs do right noobs to crypto do this where they come in when the price is going Up and then they leave in the prices going down But you know at the end of the day these Massive kind of companies are run by people and these people aren't experts on crypto They are new to crypto as well So any of the decisions that the company makes are really just decisions that people have made and if these people are kind of thinking Okay, well you know the price is going up this asset class is absolutely massive We need to get in because already gone up this much It's the same thing guys it's still people at the end of the day And if you think that these people just because they may be smart in one area that you know just because they maybe maybe there's Like they're a really smart Successful executive at KPMG for example doesn't mean they have any Context or kind of like any knowledge of crypto right if they're a complete crypto noob They're not going to be an expert on it overnight especially when it comes to the assets themselves because as we all know crypto can move very very quickly in a short amount of time and Cause an extreme amount of FOMO and that affects not just individuals, but corporations as well because those individuals in the corporation Responsible for the decisions that that the corporations kind of make here But yeah anyway glad to see KPMG do this with BTC and ETH looking forward to more companies putting ETH onto their balance sheet So You'll have been hearing about dank sharding a lot lately I've been talking about on the refuel Polyna has been a very big cheerleader of it, and they put out a great threat Three a great thread today on Twitter kind of describing it by comparing it to bit torrent So Polyna said dank sharding is not like existing blockchains It's more like bit torrent But with the Ethereum but with Ethereum security the more peers you have a more decentralized The faster things get over and above this things keep improving over time as bandwidth and storage gets cheaper So the reason why this analogy makes sense is because for anyone who's ever used torrenting software the more peers that you have right though and the more people that you're connected to the Faster your downloads are and obviously this is capped by the bandwidth that you have from your ISP But you can get like to the maximum amount that your ISP is given you by having the right amount of peers If you've only got one peer then the downloads going to be much slower Especially because their upload speed might be very might be might be quite slow, right? So if you have like a many more peers your downloads better Then it would be otherwise and this is the same is true for sharding in the Ethereum context because as I've explained before with Ethereum Post-merge with validators the more validators we have the more shards we can have which means the more capacity we have for layer twos which gives us obviously the The kind of like more more scalability and the cheaper fees there So I think you know, it's a great analogy and then Polina goes on to say Tazo Celestia Polygon avail are also developing similar solutions. There's growing awareness around roll-ups But there's work to be done on information about what pushes roll-ups to being nigh infinitely scalable with decentralization It's a razor-coated da or data availability proven data layers I see too many very important people still thinking there always be a trade-off between decentralization and throughput Hence antiquated metaphors like cities and skyscrapers quite the opposite the most decentralized data availability layers Will host the highest throughput on roll-ups So I mean Polina is basically telling us that like we need to stop thinking that block chains are inherently less scalable The the more decentralized they get because we flip that on its head as I've explained to you as before We flip that on its head with the ethereum kind of like modular approach here With being able to kind of like scale via layer to keep layer 1 decentralized and the more decentralized it gets the more scalable the layer 2s get which is the biggest breakthrough in I think blockchain since Bitcoin was invented to be honest Like I think it's that big and I don't think the the implications of that have been Kind of like understood by most people in the ecosystem Everyone chases things like you know layer twos I've been talking about them for so long and now just over the last maybe two three months people are finally waking up to layer Twos on a theorem being like, okay Wow, okay these things actually work and that's because they can use them Like I totally get it if you're being told of something and something is coming It's it's completely different to actually being able to use it because think about the history of kind of like scaling block chains Bitcoin had had been the Bitcoin ecosystem had been promising that the lightning network was gonna fix all of the scaling issues Since a very long time ago Like I can't remember exactly when the lightning was proposed But it might have been 2013 to 2014 and it still hasn't materialized into anything and people actually compare Ethereum layer 2 to the lightning network, which is obviously a silly comparison doesn't make any sense to me, especially roll-ups But people do that. So I think that if you look at the past failures which you know in the online network is a massive Failure in my eyes at to this point. Maybe it isn't in the future But to this point it has been people will see that and they say okay Well, there's these eighth guys talking about layer to scaling we've already heard about that from the Bitcoin guys for so long You know, we'll kind of like believe it when we see it and that's exactly what happened. People are using it They're realizing that it is not just bullshit anymore. It's actually that sorry. It's not just bullshit. It's actually real And and kind of like I think that's what's changed narrative there And I think I mentioned this that the two major things that would change the narrative is these things actually going live and and they tokens essentially and obviously the Tokens are coming soon. I don't know when of course, but we'll see how that shakes out there But yeah, great little analogy from Polina are kind of comparing dang sharding to it's time to bit torn here So another major exchange announced support for our trim today So FTX now has a deposit and withdrawal support for the arbitrary one main net. I'll be honest guys I did not expect them to do this this quickly Like I've actually been blown away by how quick finance and FTX have supported arbitrum, you know, obviously in a theorem layer, too When obviously FTX has a major stake in Solana They are a huge benefactors and huge ecosystem investors in Solana and finance has a huge stake in BSC Both of these networks are a theorem competitors, but I've been proven wrong here I didn't think it would happen this fast You can probably find a reef reef you up or so where I said that I didn't think it would happen this fast and I'm disappointed By coin base for for not doing it fast I mean they announced back in August late August of 2021 that they were working on integrating a theorem scaling solutions And they haven't even integrated the polygon POS chain yet, which is actually easier than the layer twos from a technical and integration standpoint At least that's how I kind of like at least I think it is they haven't even integrated that yet So it's been like what six months since then Whereas FTX and blindness have both integrated arbitrum one now Which I'm sure other layer twos are coming and there's other major exchanges that have integrated with arbitrum as well such as by bit and Hobby, so yeah, I just I really am disappointed that coin base is dragging their feet here I understand that they are a huge exchange. They have a lot of kind of like I'm technical hurdles to work through maybe they didn't have the right people on board to do this But if it was a priority for them, it wouldn't have taken them this long to do it It'll come eventually, but if it was actually like on top of their list of priorities. Yeah, it would have been done I think that it's simply because it's just not enough demand yet for it because we don't have people you know that hold tokens and they're not gonna go shill with their favorite things to To coin base and stuff like that But I think being a more forward-looking exchange is how you win and that's exactly why Binance and FTX have such large volumes They have a very they are very forward-looking exchanges barring whatever opinions you have of of these exchanges and of their leaders They've been at the forefront of crypto for a long time. That's why they grew so fast That's why I took market share away from other players because they were able to kind of like evolve much faster some of it was for regulatory reasons obviously coin bases in the US and they can't move as fast as FTX is non US exchange and Binance is non US exchange, but at the end of the day I there shouldn't really be any regulatory hurdles around supporting a theorem layer twos or scaling solutions Because it's the same thing as supporting in a layer one blockchain because you're just withdrawing assets to on chain right at the end of the day so Hopefully they do it soon because honestly I I think coin bait having coin base on board is a bigger win than FTX and Binance At at this point in time just because I think when base has more customers, especially More newer and rates retail customers who are much more sensitive to fees than maybe FTX and Binance users are because a lot of them are traders But yeah, we'll kind of like see how that plays out there But very very awesome to see FTX supporting the Albatrum one main net here So speaking of polygon, they have announced an absolutely massive fund ratio 450 million dollars led by Sequoia, which is a huge kind of like web to a VC fund here that That's been venturing into v3 lately. But yeah, these are I mean, there's a bunch of investors involved in this round There is obviously as I said Sequoia which are kind of like led the round Sequoia capital India in particular With participation from the SoftBank Vision Fund to Galaxy Digital Galaxy Interactive Tiger Global Republic Capital and more prominent investors Yeah, and they're also a bunch of Of other kind of like investors like Alameda Research which again is funny because they're aren't part of FTX Animoca brands which you may have heard of Union Square Ventures obviously massive there Dragonfly Capital a bunch of others. I'm not gonna read them all out. Of course So I guess congrats to polygon on this raise is huge. I did it's it's it's crazy. Like how far polygon has come I put a tweet out actually I think today where I said, you know Matic which was what polygon was before I mean obviously the token is still called Matic but like polygon re-bounded to polygon But when they were Matic Network, they've been around for a while and they were this scrappy Ethereum scaling startup No one really knew what they were doing. You know people they were kind of like, okay, they're doing plasma stuff But we don't really understand it You know, what can we use what can we do and I'll be honest until I started kind of like getting more involved Obviously in coming on board as an advisor. I wasn't even aware of like what though what they were really doing But then when they you know, kind of saw the polygon vision I was like, holy shit This is gonna be massive. Like I knew it from back then I knew it was gonna be huge because it was just like I was like, oh, I'm gonna be a big fan of it I'm gonna be huge because it was just such a beautiful vision for a theorem like a whole scaling suite a whole scaling ecosystem and The team I mean, they're just like juggernauts really and in my tweet I said that it's like they went from the scrappy little start-up that was Matic to this Absolutely, absolutely juggernaut that is polygon now raising a shit ton of money acquiring You know the ZK teams for a crap ton of money having a massive market cap all this sort of stuff It's just the biggest glob ever as I said in the tweet It really is is quite amazing to see how it's all played out and it's not just about kind of the market cap and the money That they've raised and stuff like that, but it's also about the tech that they've brought to the table I mean the POS chain obviously is you know Is the least interesting thing that they have going for them because it's just because just an EVM chain But the thing is it's helped us get to a point where you know We had that before we had roll-ups so people could experience cheap aetherium on a socially aligned are kind of like chain like the POS chain with aetherium instead of going to one of the more hostile kind of like ecosystems out There and from as far as I know the polygon POS chain still has the most users out of any EVM chain Even aetherium layer one at this point in time, which is pretty cool And then obviously they have all their roll-up solutions coming all they come like ZK stuff coming They have their data availability stuff coming that have the SDK and there's so much going on Right. They have this sovereign chains and side chains and all that sort of stuff So they've just kind of like I mean and and mind you guys they only rebranded All kind of like pivoted to the polygon vision at the start of or I guess like late 2020 early 2021 It has only been a year a year and maybe two three months at most and they've done all of this So when you really zoom out and see that that's when stuff gets extremely crazy Right and and you know the market is obviously kind of like rewarded that I believe when I I think Back then when I signed up to be an advisor I think the Matic token price was like two cents or something like that. And now it's what two dollars So obviously the market has rewarded them for all this growth as well and they really set the playbook for L1 incentives to where Because the L1 or the old L1 all copied the polygon POS chains incentive program for liquidity mining and stuff like that But yeah, so that was cool to see but yeah, congrats on this raise I'm gonna stop it there because you guys know I'm an advisor here I don't want to show you too much on polygon, but you guys know that you guys know that I'm a big polygon guy Have been supporting them for a while now and just great to see this kind of race. Yeah, it's obviously gives them a lot of money They're gonna have runway forever, you know, they're gonna keep executing on their vision to bring aetherium to the world So an update on the l2 uniswap liquidity mining proposal from litter Cohen here that I've spoken out before So the first audit results have been received all minor issues addressed waiting for a final report Designs by Sal or here are done and you can see the kind of designs here Carter McAleister McAleister here is working on the front end and David Mihal is continuing to work on the contracts and and more here. So Sorry, I should go here down here the headless working group Oh the litter Colin continues the headless working group now even has a logo and a temporary domain at uniswap staking.com You can see the l2 2022 logo here. These are awesome lawyers. I love these and then yeah I guess like a little comment to say as soon as the app is completed and we have final order report We will submit the government's proposal on Chen hopefully kick off the liquidity mining So this is the liquidity mining for our uniswap on l2 Which is obviously going to be a very very big deal get a lot of liquidity on there We're gonna you know Hopefully we can really kick start l2 2022 and get the flywheel going without the native token incentives from the actual L twos themselves So so yeah, there's an update on what's happening with that All right, so a new kind of project out of the other ecosystem today They've been teasing for quite a while called lens protocol now lens protocol describes itself as a permissionless Composable and decentralized social graph that makes building a web3 social platform easy from the team that bought you the other protocol So lens protocol is trying to be decentralized social media But they're not trying to be something like we've seen in the past where it's a monolithic architecture They're going for a modular Architecture where you can plug and play and do a bunch of different things with it. So all the details are in this thread I'm not gonna dive deep into it here because you can learn all about it here But they're actually blending a bunch of different kind of like things together and I should say this is actually gonna be on the polygon POS chain, it's currently live on the Mumbai test net and the polygon Mumbai test net but it will be on the main net Relatively soon. But yeah, they're blending NFTs together here dows together here For profiles and stuff like that. They're doing a lot of a lot of cool things using IPFS There's actually a lot going on here. That's why I can't really summarize it in a couple of minutes on the refuel I want you guys to go and read it and to kind of I really take in all of this because I mentioned yesterday How I thought that every attempt at decentralized social media up until this point has been pretty shitty and hasn't actually worked This is the first attempt after reading about it that I'm actually excited about and that I think actually can work Because of the modular approach it means that you're not locked into any one kind of like website or any one kind of like I guess like interface or anything like that Everything is modular like your profiles modular the your poster modular your pictures music videos all that sort of stuff Your profiles all that all that kind of like stuff there and because of that you can you can bring that to wherever you want to Bring it to and that I think is the true kind of like vision for decentralized social media for web3 and things like that As well, so definitely go give all the documentation a read you can sign an open letter at lens dot dev dot Let's show your support for it and everything like that and as I said it is live on the polygon at Mumbai testnet Which with it going live on main net? In an alpha capacity Soon so very much looking forward to playing around with it on main net as well and and and definitely been playing around with it On on the testnet works quite well so far, but yeah, this is really cool I'm you know as I said I want to say I truly just decentralized social media play out and I'm really excited I think this is the the best attempt so far at it I mean early days still but this is the one that I'm most excited for right now Especially because it's being backed by the other protocol team who obviously you know they ship they they they make great products they you know have a lot of fun what a faith in them and Obviously this is being built as a community project too, so we're gonna see how that all shakes out there Alright so another great thread from Bartek from the L2b team here today about bridges so obviously not gonna read out the thread, but you can go check it out for yourself I've spoken about bridges so much on the refuel the last few months It's very important to always understand. I guess like the risks and have a risk framework for Assessing bridges, and I think this thread actually gives you a really great breakdown I know I said that l2b are working on getting like a kind of like pages set up for bridges on their website And that's still coming, but you can use that to get a better view of what's going on Coming, but you can use this thread right now as a way to kind of like a form of risk framework in your head Around what bridges to use what are the risks you know how to protect yourself all that sort of stuff there? So I just wanted to highlight this thread and definitely go check it out. It'll be linked in the YouTube description below Alright final update here so set protocol announced today that they have released their perpetual protocol integration on optimism So this this follows obviously the recent optimism deployment that said did and and plans to enable innovative structured products on layer 2 Ecosystems so you can go here. There's a kind of like blog post has been posted here With set protocol kind of like integrating with perpetual protocol and all the details about that obviously you know perpetual protocol has been very popular in the past and so has sets and I'm biased maybe because I've worked I worked at set But yeah if you want all the information about that definitely go check out the the blog post here Because there's kind of I guess like links to different things going on and all that sort of stuff as well And then you've also got kind of like an index that was launched called the saloona avax index Which is funny because there's an l1 index. That's on l2 and you know and it's being Part sorry it's being powered by galleon Dow and beverage finance as well So there's a lot of different integrations going on here a lot of partnerships happening I love to see these stuff happening on layer 2 as well because obviously it's all about Getting more and more people to l2 getting more and more projects on there getting more and more composability going on as well So I think on that note that's gonna be it for today So thank everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give it a thumbs up subscribe to The newsletter join the disco channel and I'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone

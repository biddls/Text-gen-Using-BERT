 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the deadly gray refuel. Where we cap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Stan the Sosano and today's the 10th of May 2022. Alright everyone, let's get into it. So I think you all know what I'm going to be talking about for probably the next 10-15 minutes and that is the absolute craziness that went on over the last 24 hours. I guess like not in the Ethereum ecosystem but like in the crypto ecosystem more broadly. Now if you've been living under a rock over the last 24 hours you won't know what I'm talking about but the TLDR is that the UST stablecoin basically imploded on itself. It went to like 60 cents I think it bottomed out at I think it's currently 90 cents. So it's still off peg and it imploded exactly the way pretty much everyone said it would. Now the reason why this was crazy is because it took the rest of the market with it. There was a lot of contagion risk here. Some of the reserves that were kind of like set up to make sure UST got off peg included Bitcoin, so BTC which was sold I think there was a billion and a half worth of BTC sold to try and defend the peg. There are a lot of other kind of bigger players buying into it trying to defend the peg and selling off other assets like the other not over the last 24 hours but I think a couple days ago JUMP which is a prop trading firm within crypto sold like a lot of ETH to try and kind of like keep that peg stable there. And yeah it just didn't work. There was just too much sell pressure. The Luna token went down over 50% over the last 24 hours. Just a crazy kind of like volatility there for that ecosystem. And as I said it's still not back to peg. Confidence is completely lost in it in my eyes. Like people are trying to equate UST with USDT saying oh USDT the being Tether has lost its peg in the past and it's been fine. But they're two completely different things to me right. I mean UST is what we call an algorithmic stablecoin. USDT is just a centralized stablecoin with kind of like assets backing it. Now whether those assets exist or not has always been a debate over the years in crypto. But you know maybe in USDT's kind of like case it helps that no one really knows right. So but they're just completely different kind of like things there. So what I wanted to kind of like focus on was a few different things got to do with this. In terms of kind of like being kind of like diving deeper into all the mechanisms behind UST and how it all works and that sort of stuff. I'm not going to go through that today. I'm going to direct you to this blog post here that you can read from M. Honcalcillo. I hope I said that right. It's basically just like a short blog post going through what happened to UST and kind of how it all works. So definitely recommend giving this a read. I'll link it in the description for you below there. But one thing I really wanted to focus on was this kind of like trend that doesn't just exist within crypto obviously but it's pretty pronounced in crypto of these kind of like cults of personality right. And I think I've spoken about this on the refill before but crypto loves their cults of personality. They love the especially the first cyclists the kind of like noobs. They love looking for someone that's kind of like promising them all these things usually got to do with making money and just like completely latching onto that. Now a few examples of this is like Charles Hodgkinson right from Cardano. Definitely a massive cult of personality around him. Daniel Sestar before that kind of whole ecosystem exploded as part of the frog nation. Andre Cronjey with obviously his old ecosystem that he was building before that imploded. There's this and I guess recently DoKwon from Terra and he hasn't tweeted over the you know in a while now. He was tweeting over the last few days like shit posting basically kind of like calling everyone out insulting everyone and now he hasn't tweeted in a while because the thing actually imploded and probably doing damage control and all that sort of stuff there. But the theme is the same right. There's always this kind of big personality, charismatic, extremely ego driven. That's kind of like the big trend amongst them all that manages to build a following. Maybe that's because the token that they're associated with has gone up in price and the people kind of like holding it obviously feel richer and they're like attributing that wealth creation to this individual and then they kind of like just follow them right. And it keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger but pretty much every time it has ended badly. Like I don't know of any big cult of personality within crypto that have ended well. And this isn't just kind of recently this is like over the years it has happened and you know it just never ends well. And that's why I always kind of like have a really big issue with this and it's kind of hard to fight these kind of like people as well because when everything is going good and people are making money you know you can't speak out. They'll just gang up on you. You get like ratioed. You get kind of less like you get silence basically. You get kind of like pushed down and it just there's no motivation to speak up in that case. That's why on Twitter I haven't really been public about my bearishness on something like UST and how I think the mechanism was fundamentally flawed and that this scenario would exactly play out. But if you've been following what I'm saying on Discord or just like privately with some of you maybe I have been calling this out for a while now. Like it just was obvious to me that this was going to happen. I mean UST is not the first algorithmic stable coin to go you know to de-peg and to go not to zero. I mean it's not zero yet but like to crash and it won't be the last. I mean there's plenty of examples especially from like DeFi summer of this playing out and we kind of like learned our lesson back then. At least the kind of like veterans learned our lessons back then but a lot of the newer people they don't know those lessons right. All they see is number go up and they get excited and like oh my god I'm making so much money this is awesome and they kind of buy into these narratives and one of the big narratives around UST was that it was a truly decentralized stable coin and I called this out. I was like no it's not right like it is not a truly decentralized stable coin at all. Like it there's so many centralized points of value within UST not just within its mechanism itself but the terror blockchain is not decentralized like it is basically depose with a few validators and these validators aren't even good like I saw some stability statistics around these validators today and they struggled because everyone was trying to obviously go for the exits with the stable coin crashing and with lunar crashing and all that sorts of stuff. So like you're just taking all this together and it's just it really is crazy like it's crazy how fast this thing moved as well and how I guess like some entities within this ecosystem you know the like as I said like jump and a few others out there are kind of like willing to defend this thing and willing to make sure that it doesn't explode for one reason or another or but yeah it's just been kind of like absolutely crazy. There's some I mean there's so much I could talk about here so many different directions I want to go I want to go in but I think the cult of personality thing is key because it happens every time right every time one of these things gets popular inevitably kind of like fails and you just have to wait. So like it's kind of like it's not a matter of like if it's going to fail it's like when and I'm sick of kind of like this stuff happening I know the ecosystem is a permissionless one and it's permissionless to build in but like frankly I'm sick of like sitting there trying to build or trying to support builders of sustainable things and just getting called out for it like I mean you guys know like I get called an ethmaxi all the time. Anytime I kind of like call it any of the other ecosystems I get called an ethmaxi but let's take stock here for a second right. Solana did exactly what I said it was going to do not just me but like a lot of the people that get called ethmaxis did exactly what we said it was going to do it was going to buckle under the load because they don't have a fee market to regulate demand the networks falling over multiple times it has stability issues all the time. Avalanche the sea chain we said that the fees are going to go up with more usage because it's just a geth fork right it's just an evm fork what happened the fees went up. Terra obviously we said that it was going to kind of like implode because the uh what ust is going to implode because the mechanism behind that is fundamentally unsound again that played out like I mean I could keep going I'm not trying to inflate my own ego here and as I said like I hate these cults of personality that form around people and the egomaniacs but like at some point I kind of like I look at it and I'm just like like it's not that we're trying to be right it's not that we're trying to be like I told you so it's that a lot of the people in the ethereum ecosystem have been through this so many times and we also fundamentally care about building more sustainable long term systems and we also realize that the more of these ponzis that get built and the more of them that get bigger and implode and hurt more people the faster the regulators are coming guys like this is actually one thing that concerns me a lot in crypto is the kind of like regulators and how how they'll use this as ammo against us like I mean Elizabeth Warren has been going on about stablecoin risk recently right she's not going to differentiate between ust die usdc usd no she's just going to look at them all the same and she's going to use this as a as a talking point I would bet to say you know we need to we need to kind of regulate stablecoins because look what happens when we don't right and I've said before that I think that regulators have no power when we build truly decentralized systems so that's why I'm so harsh on these systems that I consider to be not truly decentralized because they're not going to survive a concerted regulatory onslaught like no way they're going to survive that because at the end of the day the governments have a lot of power that just private people and institutions do not right they have the power to do whatever they want essentially um I know there's checks and balances and things like that but look crypto doesn't have a good image to the outside world we are hated by a lot of the outside world for one reason or another so it's very easy for these politicians to drum up support for kind of like quote unquote banning crypto or heavily regulating it or doing any such things like that and then they can always just kind of like fit it into their existing regulatory uh kind of like framework of regulating the financial system right and it's going to happen like as I've said before they're going to go after the choke points which are the feared on-ramps they're going to go after the individuals that are doxed and that aren't anon like I don't know how doe makes it out of this without basically I don't know like I don't know how he makes it out of this he's already like the SEC already went after him but I think that was more of a kind of like frivolous thing I don't think that kind of like had much grounds to stand on but just generally I don't know how he kind of like survives this honestly like maybe he will maybe he's like a cockroach and he'll survive but I don't know I kind of like look at that I'm just like he's going to get targeted now for this right and same is true for pretty much everyone that's doxed even if they're not doing anything wrong like obviously uniswap labs has come under regulatory scrutiny and they're not doing anything wrong in my eyes but this again is why I keep promoting truly decentralized systems we need to build them we can't rely on this crap anymore guys like I'm so frustrated like actually like I'm not I'm not angry I'm disappointed and frustrated because of the fact that I mean I obviously saw this coming and I also know that this isn't going to be the last of it people are going to keep building these systems especially when the market gets bullish again we have a flood of new people come in they gravitate towards these things like flies to dog shit honestly like it's the same thing they love these things they love the ponzi's because they go up really quickly it makes people feel really rich really quickly and they love formulating cults of personality around the people that are leading these things and as I said you know cults of personality aren't a um a crypto thing they're a human thing at the end of the day and there's plenty of this kind of like um happening uh in the real world right now especially around politicians but I don't want to get into like that that part of it but just generally that that trend in crypto is always been something that I've hated and you know when you look at things like and it's funny because some people say oh there's a cult of personality around around Vitalik it's like no there's not like people respect Vitalik for his work for on merit for what he's been able to build for his brain essentially and he doesn't like I mean obviously he has a coin associated with him with eth but he's not on twitter shit posting and pumping eth and telling people to buy eth and kind of like insulting other people he's not doing any of that he's probably never done any of that I don't remember a time when he's kind of like done that but he's taken a lot of shit over the years but you know he has earned respect from pretty much everyone in this ecosystem like it's the only people who don't like him are bitcoin maximalists and you know that's for obvious reasons but I think that there's no cult of personality around him people just genuinely respect him but then there's other people who just do not deserve the respect like as I said Charles Hoskinson is one of them he I mean I'm not gonna go on about that again but like that's one there uh Dokon um I mean there's some in the avax community too like emin from avax the same thing and a bunch of others Daniel Sester, Andrea Crenjie whether they deserve the praise or not I'm not gonna debate that but it's always it always ends badly like it never ends well and I think that as I said this isn't going to be the end we're going to see more of this go on um but like it's just sad it really is sad and disappointing at the end of the day entertaining I mean at least it's entertaining right like but uh we're gonna have to see how it how it kind of like shakes out because as I said this was one of the craziest days or craziest last 24 hours that I've had in in my time in crypto I mean I remember all the craziest days I think for me um if I had to kind of like name my top five today would would make it into the top five at this point I think the other ones would be the March 2020 crash the yam launch yearn launch and maybe the sushi launch because the way I kind of like rank craziness is when something happens that like no one knows where it's going to go from here like no one can predict what's going to happen it's all happening in real time everyone's focused on it and and the five that I just mentioned is what everyone was focused on and for those of you who weren't around in March 2020 imagine the last 24 hours and what happened to Luna and UST happening to the whole market that's what March 2020 was that that particular day in March 2020 that we call I think Black Thursday that's what happened back then it was crazy no one knew it was going to happen people thought that things were literally headed to zero it was just a crazy time there and it's always good to kind of like reflect on these things and see what shakes out of it and like what is actually sustainable and what actually survives and guys like I was saying this in the discord channel before over the last 12 months every popular narrative has basically been gone to shit essentially the alt L1 trade completely gone to shit right the oh ethereum is going to fail because of high fees didn't materialize oh L2 suck didn't materialize L2s are killing it right now they're doing better than ever um a bunch of other ones like the algorithmic stablecoin stuff the frog nation all that sort of it all went to shit whereas ethereum is constant ethereum is fine ethereum is chugging along just like it always has ethereum is more bullish than ever e is more bullish than ever and I have never been more confident in ethereum's history than I am today and I think that the fact that all these other things just keep failing it just strengthens ethereum at the end of the day which is what I really like because it just shows the ecosystem it shows the world that ethereum is being built to be long-term sustainable it's not playing these games yes people can play these games on top of ethereum but ethereum as a network ethereum as an ecosystem is and kind of like the hardcore ethereum community is focused on the long term focused on the decades the centuries the sustainability into the long term rather than these short-term opportunistic gains and the funny thing is even if those these games play out on ethereum it still benefits because of the fee burn right we all get to kind of like benefit from this stuff as I said these are permissionless systems you can build whatever you want on them and I'm so glad that we have one here I'd be one five five nine implemented because of that as well but anyway I've been talking for 15 minutes about that as I said I could talk about this for a very long time there's just so much to go through so much happened but I'm going to leave it at that because a bunch of other interesting things that I wanted to get through uh today here but as I said if you want to learn more about kind of like what happened with ust and how it all works definitely give this blog post to read here from from Emma and Emma Honka Salo I'll link it in the youtube description for you to do so but I'm going to move on from that for now so Raul from prior labs Raul Jordan put out a great tweet today where he which is kind of related to what I was just saying where he said not fully in the loop regarding the markets but we are heads down working on the ethereum merge and beyond this is one of the most exciting years in the ethereum project's history and sentiment has not changed for us working on this this is exactly what I was saying the builders in ethereum their heads down they don't give a shit about this this stuff right this is all just kind of like stuff for us who kind of sit on crypto twitter to pay attention to it's important to learn from but at the end of the day like the people who are building the future of ethereum have much better things to focus their attention on not just that layer one ethereum but layer two as well and I'm glad that they don't get bogged down in this sort of stuff and it actually takes like a special kind of someone to do this to focus like I actually respect the builders who can focus in crypto because it's just there's just so much going on all the time but their heads down they're building merges still coming there's no news on the merge since I guess like the last few refuels but I'm sure we'll see something soon but yeah it's still being built out still kind of like stuff happening there but great for rule to put a tweet like this out today I think it was a very timely tweet all right so we have another set of data from data always here today who said beacon chain demand just keeps chugging along deposits near all-time high queue size increasing consensus layer is going to tick up again soon price is just noise so you can see here that the validated deposits I mean they're still at like what is it let me it's like 18,000 pending validators right now guys that's still crazy right it's been like this for a for a while now you can see here like how long the validator like the validated deposits right from basically I guess maybe end of February to now will be the beginning of March to now and this other chart shows beacon chain estimated validated activation time the queue's been persistent since since March here and then you can see the the churn limit as I discussed on the refill the other day how that churn limit every time we reach a certain validated threshold we can kind of like get more validators in and that's going to be ticking up soon so CL here stands for churn limit or consensus layer by the way guys like I'm too used to using CL as consensus layer but in this case it stands for churn limit but yeah this is this is really cool I think that obviously a lot of it's going into Lido and I've discussed that before but there's actually some stuff coming for rockerpool that I'm going to discuss soon it was mentioned in the discord channel by jasper but I said to him I'll cover it once there's an official forum post but they're making some some moves behind the scenes to make it easier for people to onboard onto onto rockerpool to stake with them so I'm super excited about that but yeah there's the ethereum staking ecosystem is so healthy right now it's just crazy I mean client diversity fund is very healthy obviously we can do better on the on the distribution of of kind of like steak but we're going to work on that that's going to come but yeah I just think this is a really cool set of charts that you can check out it'll be linked in the youtube description so thanks to data always for putting this together all right so starquares our stargate alpha is now live on mainnet this was live on testnet recently but basically stargate alpha is essentially the quote unquote official bridge for moving assets into an out of stark net so you can go check out the blog post for full details on this but basically you can kind of check it out at stargate.starknet.io you'll be able to kind of like I guess like when you accept this this terms of service thing here you can kind of like log in with metamask of course which let me see if I can just run this through for you guys quickly yeah it's sassle.eth there so metamask I'll log into sassle.eth here so connect in and then basically you can log into stark net as well by using argent x and bravos as well bravos haven't heard that well before but you can use argent x to to kind of like log in and continue with the stark net wallet as well which I think is what you will need I don't have it installed but you will need that instead of metamask here so I can't go any further than this but you can definitely check this out but it's cool to see this on mainnet finally I say finally I think it was a testnet when did testnet go live I think it went live a few weeks ago so cool to see this yeah already on mainnet and as I said like the l2 ecosystem just keeps chugging along keeps building this stuff just keeps kind of like being deployed to to mainnet and the stark ecosystem is is growing every day slow and steady I think on the l2 front but but definitely steady and speaking of l2's optimism hit a transaction day record transactions per day record today which is very very cool you can see it here on the dune analytics dashboard that's uh the optimism network saw their most transactions in a day uh ever today essentially right that's an all-time high right there and I've also got the chart up here from etherscan you can see it's just like completely mooned which is very very cool to see this is kind of like I guess like a a harbinger of things to come guys like once the as I've said been saying for a while now once these kind of like tokens get announced the in the kind of like incentive programs get started incentive programs being liquidity mining these l2s are really going to take off in a serious way and it seems optimism is already doing so here um you know you can see in the in both the dune analytics dashboard and also the etherscan kind of like chart here of that happening uh and also I guess like uh transacting addresses per day is not an all-time high but it's holding steady as well I expect that to go up soon contracts deployed per day holding steady I mean this is a really cool dashboard actually I think this has been updated since the last time I I looked at it but this is a dashboard here uh basically all about optimism that you can kind of like go uh go check out it's got a bunch of awesome stats on everything happening here I mean wow there's a lot of stats here definitely been updated since the last time I checked this so I'll link this in the youtube description for you to check out but obviously great to see optimism growing here and I hope that continues all right so compound announced this uh yesterday where the compound treasury has received a b-minus credit rating from smp global ratings this makes compound treasury the first institutional d file offering to be rated by a credit rating agency this is pretty cool uh someone made a joke in the replies here that this rating is junk status uh you can see here b-minus is a highly speculative which is considered junk but I mean what would you expect from a crypto treasury to be rated right obviously it's going to be rated at a kind of like highly speculative rating but I don't think that takes away from the point that this is a big step forward this is the first time that it institutional d file offering has been rated by one of these kind of like traditional credit rating agencies so again just continuing the trend of d-fi entering I guess like the mainstream consciousness and entering kind of like the tradify world and like chugging along there which is very cool to see so if you want to see all the details about this it's in this blog post from compound I'll link it in the youtube description it's very short so you can go check it out but yeah congrats to I guess like the uh the compound's ecosystem here for for landing this uh this uh rating so awaki put out a tweet uh today which I thought was quite timely where he said the bull market rewards those who who survive through the bear market but to survive the bear market you must be a cockroach impossible to kill this is like a really really great way of putting this because as I've mentioned plenty of times before guys there were a lot of things that did not survive the 2018 2019 bear market um at all like literally they didn't go to zero market wise but their communities pretty much went to zero and a lot of these things in 2017 were incredibly popular and I've talked about a bunch of them before EOS is a prime example here it was very very popular Neo was another one that was extremely popular these are just layer one chains but there were a bunch of apps as well that were very popular a bunch of kind of like things that were just getting a lot of attention and they're basically dead today like their market cap isn't zero but their communities are completely dead right and that's because they weren't cockroaches they didn't they weren't impossible to kill they didn't have a long lasting community they didn't have enough interesting stuff going on to hold that attention hold that community as I've said to you guys before attention is the most scarce resource in life not just within crypto and to hold that attention you need interesting things to be happening so this is why something like ethereum survives through all kinds of markets because ethereum always has the attention I mean I do a 30-minute daily show on ethereum every single weekday guys like it has everything happening on it there's always something happening doesn't even matter if it's like Christmas or New Year's there is always stuff happening on ethereum 24 7 365 days days a year it's never boring and that's why ethereum that's ethereum superpower I believe and that's what attracts so many smart people to ethereum which basically makes ethereum the the cockroach of the crypto industry and obviously that you know a similar thing is true for bitcoin but I think bitcoin and ethereum are the only two ecosystems that can claim to be cockroaches now there are other ones out there that are cockroaches that have confused me such as ripple for example that has I don't I wouldn't say it actually has much of a community I believe much of the kind of like posts you see about xrp on twitter are bots but it it just it is a cockroach like it somehow survived for a very long time now we survived I think it's a bit longer than yet survived longer than ethereum which just puzzles me I I will probably never understand it but it is what it is but in terms of like actual organic kind of like ecosystems that have kept growing that have done really well over the long term bitcoin and ethereum are the two there but I actually think bitcoin peaked I think bitcoin peaked in 2021 in terms of kind of like relevance and market cap and everything like that I think it's just going to be declining from now and I think ethereum is going to flip bitcoin sooner rather than later and ethereum will just continue to survive and thrive it's it at this point in time I wouldn't say that ethereum is impossible to kill but it's getting there guys it's getting to the point where it's getting so big it has so much attention it's getting so secure that it is going to basically be impossible to kill and that's the goal right like we want ethereum to survive everything like from you know the regulators going after it to wars to kind of like centuries worth of just humanity stuff right we want ethereum to be able to survive through all that that's what we're building towards to be like a true true cockroach so I thought I walk you put you know put it put it great like in a tweet here because as you said the bull market awards those who survive through a bear market in terms of kind of like people and stuff but to survive that bear market you must be a cockroach so yeah great way to put it here from Milwaukee so just a couple other up what actually one last update to get through before I just shout out something from immutable xr there was this new tool I can't I don't know how to pronounce it here geyser or geezer or geezer like I'm so terrible pronouncing words sometimes guys like correct me if I'm wrong but like I'm just going to call it geyser for now with which is which they're calling a fully on-chain machine learning model inference powered by stark net so there's been a bunch of these artificial intelligence projects encrypted before and a lot of them have been vaporware but this is building on stark net and using zero knowledge proofs to achieve what they want to achieve here so I'm actually quite intrigued by it like it could still be vaporware I don't know right like I'm not I'm not endorsing this project but I do want to put it on your radar because because I think that it's interesting at least and I always look out for these interesting things happening within the ecosystem and the fact that it's building on stark net is really cool as well so you can go check this out there's a blog post describing it all here it'll be linked in the youtube description for you to do so all right last up here I just wanted to shout out that immutable is hiring 20 business developers in the next 12 weeks to do strategic sales at that for top tech and gaming companies so if you know as Robbie says here if you know of a recruiting firm who specializes in these hires DM Robbie if we end up hiring through them I'll pay you 10k usd but also if you know anyone that might be fit for this role definitely message Robbie about them or if you think you may be fit for it you know DM him maybe you'll land a job at immutable which as you guys know is one of the kind of like team scaling nfts on ethereum here so just wanted to give a quick shout out there now I have a couple of minutes left here just the final thing about the the terror thing in the last 24 hours that I forgot to mention before I don't know what's going to happen from here with Tara this is why it's so exciting and so intriguing I don't know what's gonna I like I do think that usd will get back to peg eventually but I don't know if that's going to be enough like to me confidence has been shattered in a shattered in that ecosystem I will never hold usd ever even if they change the underlying mechanisms I feel like the usd stablecoin will become much less desirable just generally like the only way I think that they can kind of like salvage it at this point is by collateralizing it but that just basically makes it closer to die and they didn't want to be closer to die I mean dokwan was on twitter saying that he was going to kill die right so I don't know what's going to happen I do think the peg I mean I'm guessing the peg is going to be restored because people just going to throw money at it whatever but yeah confidence is shattered uh maybe the peg doesn't get restored maybe it just kind of like stays off peg forever I don't know I think it's going to look normalize eventually but yeah it's going to be very very interesting to see what happens from here and I think this is going to be something that people are going to be talking about for a while they're going to be referencing in the future when more of these kind of like things get spun up because the ponzi stablecoins the algorithmic stablecoins they're not over guys they're going to keep happening over and over again especially in bull markets but just be vigilant as I've always said to you guys like the worst thing you can do is blow yourself up and a lot of people blew themselves up today and they're probably going to be out of position if we if we kind of like recover and go into a new bull market eventually and it and that's the worst thing that can happen so just you know minimize your risk know the risks listen to people that are telling you that are honest people that are actually telling you these things don't try not to get caught up in like the bull market hype because that's how you wreck yourself that's how you blow yourself up um and I think at this point like you know I don't know like I don't like tooting my own horn in my own ego but I think at this point like I have called out so many of these things that I do hope that you heed my warnings when I talk about these things I don't give investment advice but I will always advise you guys or at least kind of like give you guys a heads up when I'm seeing something that is uh just kind of like setting off alarm bells in my head because I want you guys to make it like that's that's literally like one of my goals with the daily way it's like as I said I don't give you a direct investment of us I'm not going to tell you what to buy I'm not going to tell you you know when to sell none of that sort of stuff but I am going to give you the advice or I kind of I guess I pass down the wisdom to you that I've accumulated over my years in crypto and I'm going to hope that you kind of like you know heed those guys got that advice and heed those warnings and make it yourself um but on that note I think that's going to be it for today's episode so thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give it a thumbs up subscribe to newsletter join the disco channel and I'll catch you all tomorrow thanks everyone

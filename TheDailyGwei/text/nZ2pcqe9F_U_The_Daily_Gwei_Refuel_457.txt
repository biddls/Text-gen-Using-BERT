 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the deadly grave refuel where we kept the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host dan that is a sign on today the 29th of september 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it So a few things to go through today with regards to core ethereum development here And I just wanted to start with this tweet that was put out by brock almore here Who is the chief architect at nascent which is a um a fund in the space? So he said lukewarm take geth needs to adapt or die a cooler and aragon are an order of magnitude better or more on multiple axes axis And geth will hold back and slow down improvements to l1s and l2s hats off for what is done It's done for the ecosystem, but now it's 661 000 lines of tech debt This is obviously a pretty scathing tweet, uh towards geth But I completely disagree with this Uh, and for a number of reasons and i'll go through the tweet that peter obviously the team lead at geth Put out here first before I dive into my own thoughts here He said can you guys please just make that better client than geth already and everyone can switch over to it You've been saying if I in years now I just want to retire and it's annoying that everyone keeps promising me that I can but nobody delivers the salvation client already Obviously he's being tongue in cheek here There is no such thing as a perfect client and he knows that uh, but he has a point the ethereum execution layer Client diversity as we all know is still pretty bad, right? It's 80 dominated by geth But what that really shows is that people are using geth over the alternatives, right? Such as eragon such as a cooler such as base suit, right? So geth must be doing something right like geth mustn't be as bad as everyone says it is Uh because 80 of the network is using it. I mean like i've used geth plenty of times in the past Uh, and there's never mind as well, of course, um, and i've used i've i've used all of the clients But the reason why or at least one of the major reasons why geth is still so popular is because it is stable It has a very stable. It's a very stable client that's been around since day one. It's reliable uh, it doesn't have all these edge case bugs that a lot of the other clients have and the Other clients such as eragon are actually a fork of geth Obviously it's been modified since but it's still using the geth code base under the hood So I think it's very very uh, I guess like um harsh by brock of brock here to say that geth is Tech debt or death geth needs to adapt or die I think geth should keep doing what it's doing by being a stable and reliable client And leave it up to the other clients to do other things like maybe making it easier to sync an archive node Which is what eragon has done right and on top of this during the merge testing process Eragon and the other clients I believe had many more bugs or many more kind of like issues than geth did and that again Speak to that stability that geth has and that and that um reliability that geth has that the other clients Just don't have at this point in time. They're not up to the same level as geth in that regard and I believe even like right up until the Merge happened and even post merge eragon was having issues with block production right having bugs there on main net now I don't want to bash eragon or anything like that. It's a great client and I think all the execution layers clients are great But if you know you want to come at the king which is geth you uh, you got to do a lot more than just Build a client for a couple of years and you know make it sink maybe an archive node fast or anything like that The true measure I think of a client is its stability and reliability Everything else is just a bonus on top of that that that is basically table stakes You have to be a stable client and you have to be reliable or else especially if you're not a stable client Or else especially in a post merge world where if an execution layer client falls over Well, if you're a validator then you need to get that back up and running or else you're not validating anymore You're actually uh offline as as viewed by the network and you are not earning rewards anymore So it's extremely important for things to be stable That's again why geth is at 80 percent because people know that it's stable They know that it's secure and they know that it's reliable. So I don't know why brock put this out Uh, I really don't think that this was uh, very very nice of him to put this out. I'm all for giving constructive feedback But he's basically just said that geth just needs to go away because it's it's it's tech debt when that is the furthest from the truth Like it doesn't matter that geth has been around so long And that it has a lot of uh, maybe I guess like in the objective sense of the word tech debt or redundant Kind of things that it does or it could do things better That's again not the point of the geth client. The point is to be stable and reliable and on that front as well I think this is one thing that people who aren't in software development don't understand is that you can add plenty of features But you have to maintain those features, right? Uh, you can't just add a feature and then that's it like it's done and there's nothing to maintain That's not how it works at all. And if you want to do software like that, then it becomes extremely limiting So for example the bitcoin network extremely limited, but it's stable and reliable, right? It's still producing blocks It has it has had bugs in the past, but they've been relatively minor There has been a a couple of critical ones, but they've been fixed But uh, it's you know, it's stable and reliable and but in in turn it's extremely simple Because features aren't added very often to the bitcoin code base Whereas within ethereum features are added all the time to the protocol I mean, we just did one of the biggest or the biggest feature upgrade in ethereum's history with the merge That stuff doesn't just happen once you can't just deploy the feature and that's it. There needs to be maintenance. There needs to be um, Uh, someone kind of making sure that things are running smoothly There needs to be someone there to fix things if anything kind of goes wrong And that all falls back into something being stable and reliable, which is what I think geth has I mean that is what geth has earned since genesis being a stable and reliable client and being an enduring client I mean the other only other client that was around since then Was the parity client which actually I've gone through this before but was retired and then it became open ethereum Which ultimately became uh, well ultimately that effort was put towards What's eragon here because uh the people that were supporting open ethereum gnosis have are supporting eragon now Uh, and now we have a cooler as well. And then there's nethermind of course, which are in nethermind's definitely independent They've been around for a little while now, but geth has been there since genesis Uh, so has peter peter has literally been working on geth since genesis back in 2015 So I think that he knows a thing or two about ethereum core development, right? and I think that uh, he you know his points around why having people switched is very salient like it's because Geth is reliable and stable and i've said that enough times already. I think i've made my point But uh, yeah, I just wanted to go through that for people that may have seen this thread today And may not realize why people are still using geth. It's got nothing to do with Uh, you know it just being around the longest, right? Otherwise people would still be using parity and open ethereum Uh, what's it got to do with is the fact that it has been maintained it is stable. It is reliable And people live using it especially in a post merge world where the reliability and stability of an execution layer client is Uh, what makes or breaks their validators right in simple terms. So yeah, anyway moving on from that to another tweet from Ryan shawn adams today where he said we need fewer eth killers. We need more killer apps. This is so true I've talked about this on the refill before but Like how many times have these eth killers coming out right all these other layer ones come out and say we've got unlimited scalability We've got all these block space blah blah blah and that block space never gets filled up We have way more block space available in crypto than there is being used, right? Like obviously ethereum block space has been at 100 capacity for a very long time But literally no other chain not even bitcoin during the bear market is at 100 capacity all the time, right? Nothing else. So they've got the block space, but there's just no demand to use it And the same is true for layer 2 layer 2 still have plenty of block space, especially with arbitrum with nitro They got plenty of block space available, but the demand isn't there now, of course, we're in a general bear market right now So demand is generally lower but the thing is is that people and and funds and developers and builders have just Way over indexed on these layer ones and under indexed on actually building killer applications right now I would say there's only really two things that you could say with certainty having during product market fit and that is NFTs and DeFi and even NFTs some people will say that it was a fad I don't believe it's a fad but people will say it's a fad. So really you could just say that DeFi and the things that fall into that such as a money or a store value such as ethan btc Are really the only things in terms of use cases that we have and then you can argue Well, that's why ethereum has such the ethereum block space is so valuable because that's where DeFi is that is literally like where the majority of DeFi sits today, right? No, I'm not just talking about TVL. I'm talking about all the metrics surrounding that So when you think of it like that Like we I don't just want to see less eth killers because I think they're totally pointless But I just want to see more killer apps I want to see things taking advantage of the block space that is already available today Not more protocols spinning up more Sorry, not more protocols being spun up with more block space that no one's going to use paid for by a token inflation With vcs that got in early and then they're just dumping on everyone like it's just so toxic and so Extractive it doesn't actually add any value to the ecosystem All it does is make the early buyers into these things richer Because usually it's the same vcs the same funds who just recycle through these things they call every new l1 Next generation and all that crap, right? And there's just been way too much focus on that rather than focusing on those on more applications Doesn't have to be a quote unquote killer application, but just more applications in general that actually use the block space that we have today Rather than trying to create more block space just to become a ghost chain But yeah, I just wanted to make a comment on that because I see this way too often in crypto and I was thinking about it Just before actually like the amount of people that like shill these l1s and you see them like on twitter You see them on reddit and everywhere like that and then I reckon the majority of those people haven't even used the damn thing Because you look at the on-chain usage and it's basically non-existent So these people are just literally buying into an ecosystem that they've probably heard someone talk about on youtube or they've heard someone Maybe someone shield it to them in real life or something, right? Maybe their friends are all about it But they're just buying it on a centralized exchange and they're not even actually using the chain at all and in that world like you can see why we have this saturation of block space because even the people who are Saying that they're the most bullish on a particular l1 Aren't even using it like I mean I use ethereum all the time. I'm sure all of you do as well We use layer twos. We love it. We love getting amongst it But from my experience most of the other l1 ecosystems their participants or their community are really just speculators They're really just mercenaries. They don't actually use anything and if they did I think they would quickly Realize how broken a lot of these things are I mean i've actually explored these other l1s And holy shit, like people say the ethereum ux and ui is bad and is poor and doesn't lend itself to mass adoption Which is fair but compared to the other layer ones it is so far ahead guys Like I don't know if you've used some of the other layer ones out there I'm not going to name names because I don't want to don't want to go down that path But like some of them are just absolutely atrocious like they're just so confusing And and you when you use it you realize that all these top-level narratives that people always talk about Aren't true they break down extremely quickly when you actually try to use the thing think about I will name one name because it's a perfect example Think about cardano all the hype leading up to their smart contract launched and then smart contracts launched and people realized That it was extremely limited because it uses the utxo model accounting model, right? And it could only do whatever it was one transaction per block or something on chain and things like that So like people finally realize like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh The narrative of cardona getting smart contracts and automatically taking over the crypto space is actually not true And oh, wow, it's not as scalable as I thought it would be and all these other things that happen It's because narratives are easy to spread like words are cheap But actually using the thing and realizing that those narratives are false most people won't do most people will just keep listening to the youtubers That tell them everything's going to be all right. Everything's going to pump, you know, buy this thing blah blah And they're going to keep getting uh, I guess like fed those narratives but they're going to keep getting Like fed those narratives perpetually but until you actually use the thing you don't know what's true and what's not Whereas I have used most of them and I can tell you that most of them are garbage like not even just because they've got No product market fit. They're just impossible to use so complicated and I just come back to ethereum and i'm like, okay I can see how ethereum Is easy for me to use because i'm so used to it But like just taking a step back and looking at it Meta mask and and interacting with ethereum generally and all the tooling and all the infrastructure around it Is so far ahead of all these other ecosystems That's uh, I think that's definitely something that is not praised enough and not brought up enough within the crypto ecosystem All right on to a fresh regulatory update here So uh yesterday the cftc filed a declaration informing the court that it seeks to Perfect services of process of a lawsuit on every voting member of okeydow via its chatbot and forum posts So I talked about this I believe last week or the week before about how the cftc is going after okeydow formerly known as bzx but not only the uh operators but I guess not only the centralized team behind it But everyone that participated in the dow which is obviously scary because if they're going after People who have just voted on a snapshot proposal for example or being participants in the dow via forum posts and chatbots Uh, that means you potentially are liable here Which is crazy because all this is going to do is do that chilling effect again Which is going to scare people off participating in governance and the problem is Is that we've already had really low governance turnout for a lot of these things for other reasons And now this is just another reason on top of it. So the meme of like governance tokens is just taking another hit. I mean If no one wants to vote on these things because they could have uh could draw the eye of regulators Well, I mean that just is really really bad for the ecosystem generally, but not only that It's also bad for any kind of value accrual for these tokens That's the bearish take here the bullish take or I guess like the other side of things Is that this doesn't actually happen the cftc, uh steps back or they lose or whatever Uh, but right now it's not looking too too good Uh based on what they're trying to do here and I had Hope that the cftc wouldn't go down a similar path that the sec has gone down with regards to coming On hard against crypto, uh, but it seems like they're going even harder I mean, I don't even think the sec went this far like this is pretty far guys charging people who Or I guess like at least going after people who voted on things within a dow Um, even if they were a small holder and didn't really have much I guess like say in the matter That's that's pretty crazy when you think about that Um, but we're gonna have to see what shakes out here and how this uh progresses but not very uh, not very good news That's for sure All right, so I came across this project, uh the other day, uh called stacker network And this is basically something that I spoke about a couple weeks ago where I said that I I was quoting Uh, ryan b's tweet on twitter where he was talking about a tool that was uh, Allowed people to easily deploy their own roll-up on ethereum, right? Well, that's exactly what stacker network is building They're building an sdk for building application specific roll-ups, uh using a independent or a decentralized network of independent sequences Uh, and this is really cool I mean This is this thread from katokia who uh works at rnd in the uh private uh scaling privacy and scaling explorations group at the ethereum Foundation who's also working on uh stacker network here and he says excited to finally share what I had been working on in the past Few days and more so because l2 infrastructure made easy app specific roll-ups for all right on ethereum If you're interested in the project and want to collaborate or just want to chat about it dms always open So that's a shout out there for that for um participating there But what this basically does and I watched the demo video of this is it basically gives you this tweet from from ryan Berkman's here who I just mentioned Well, you basically go in the command line as a developer you say I want to essentially spin up and roll up right or spin up a um Roll up that's ready to go and have specific roll up And I want to do it on ethereum mainnet and then all that happens in the background and you're ready to go Now the reason why we would want this is because we want to compete with networks such as cosmos that actually offers this Functionality for their own application specific chain. So obviously not a roll-up but a chain and you remember dy dx cited one of the reasons that they weren't um I guess like uh sticking with ethereum sticking with the roll-up was because they believed that the cosmos sdk Is better suited their needs because it allowed them to do all these sorts of stuff and allowed them to I guess like plug and play And edit or I mean configure their roll-up whichever way they wanted to well That's exactly what stacker network is trying to do here. So i'm super excited about this I am really glad that someone is finally building this because It's definitely overdue Uh, and I think that uh, it hasn't been around for very long yet But they seem to have built a lot from the demo video that I watched and they were also a finalist of eath global I have the eath glow. Uh, sorry of the eath online event held by eath global And i've got the tweet here of all the finalists, but you can see here that stacker network is one of those So obviously a project that has also been noticed by the eath online judges, which is very very cool but I think generally this is needed for So it's not only needed for developers and to make developers lives easier I think it's just needed for ethereum to be able to compete Uh on this front with other things like the cosmos sdk if I had to say one nice thing about cosmos I don't hate cosmos or anything like that But I think just cosmos generally their model doesn't really make much sense and their architecture doesn't really make much sense But if I had to say one nice thing about it Is that that cosmos sdk from everything that i've heard is very uh appealing to developers So if we can take that concept and apply it to a roll-up or an app specific roll-up sdk And sdk stands for software development kit for you non-devs out there But essentially if we can take that and apply it to roll-ups Well, then we should in theory get a much more vibrant app specific roll-up ecosystem And have much more competition in the ecosystem as well. So very cool to see this you can read this thread I'll link it in the youtube description below and i'll also link the tweet with the eath online finalists as well As there's more than just stacker network in here. There's a bunch of them and they're all linked and talked about in this thread All right, so uh timare here and she has introduced a meta block mev dashboard Which is a set of aerated mev stats on ethereum now. I think I remember highlighting an early uh, An early on iteration of this uh a few weeks ago, maybe a couple months ago at this stage But essentially what this allows you to do is enter a transaction hash or block number to look at all the mev Around that now I don't have one handy right now But there is a dashboard that you can kind of look at and it shows you here, uh, the various metrics around mev Yeah, I remember I showed this on the on the refuel a little while ago But there there's an explorer here as well that you can plug into and timare's thread goes into a bit more detail about this as well So I just wanted to highlight this because I know mev is always a big topic on everyone's mind You can check this out. I'll link it in the youtube description below All right an update here out of cismo today So they've got a new zk badge that you can uh that you can you qualify for If you participated in gitcoin grants around 15, so this is really cool So say you donated to gitcoin grants around 15 from a private wallet from a wallet that you don't want associated With your identity at all But you still want to prove that you participated in the round Well now you can you can mint this gitcoin contributor zk badge to your public ens wallet and signal your support to ethereum Because the way the cismo protocol works is that it basically cryptographically guarantees that you did participate in the round But on a different wallet and that badge is minted from that wallet But it doesn't reveal what that wallet is. It won't actually reveal anything about that wallet So people can see that the proof that you participated in this round cryptographic proof that you participated in this round But they can't actually see from which wallet you participated from This is super cool Like this is one of the things that non-financial things in ethereum that i'm most excited about like the use cases of this Are massive and I was talking about this in this in the dailyware discord channel the other day. We were talking about this recent Optus is a large telecommunications company in australia They recently had a massive data breach or I think up to 10 million customer records or I guess like customers records were Were breached here and I was saying how that with this technology that cismo is working with you can basically Imagine a world where you have a thing where everyone stores their data on their own personal device There's no need to store it on a centralized database within you know optus's servers or some other server out there You can store all your personal data on your device And then when you need to kyc with a provider or aml with someone you can basically have a badge in in this context That proves who you are without having to reveal any of the information and on top of that You can actually revoke that badge at any time and from that provider so you can basically take away Uh their their view of things from from them at any time This is huge guys like like data protection data privacy is a massive issue in Uh, the normal web 2 internet world like it's huge the the amount of hacks that go on the amount of data that's leaked everywhere The little digital financial not financial private little digital privacy that we have is is I mean We basically don't really have digital privacy, right? It's basically non-existent and I think people were looking more and more as time goes on for tools to protect themselves So if I had the option to be able to keep all my data on my local device Protected by a secure element such as on the iphone through face id or passcode or anything like that Where only whoever has access to my device can access that just absolutely massive and this falls into Something uh like signing with ethereum or like your ethereum wallet in general where when you've got your hardware wallet For example, and you've got your private key stored on there in a secure element the only way to access that private key or to access that that element or to access the um, The the signing infrastructure which is the button that you press to sign a transaction is to have physical access to that device So the most important part it stays on the device, which is the private key You sign a transaction with it and then it goes off and you have cryptographic proof that you actually own that address Because you've signed it with your hardware wallet and there's no need for your private key to be exposed to digital infrastructure To infrastructure that's connected to the internet and that obviously is very good for security But the same concepts apply to uh data we can protect data in the same way We just got to build the infrastructure to do it and I I've disclosed this before but another disclosure I am an investor in CISMO, but it's because I mean i'm not an investor Uh, sorry, i'm not chilling them because i'm an investor I'm an investor because i'm super excited about what they're building and I want you guys to know why i'm excited about it And why I think it is one of the best non-financial use cases of uh of ethereum and obviously it has financial use cases attached to it And you can do a bunch of things around that But the fact that we have this infrastructure that we can use leveraging zk technology is awesome and I can't wait to see This get built out more and I can't wait to see more and more projects use this All right, so a new protocol called gravity protocol was announced today and they're calling themselves an eth centric borrowing protocol So they i've got a little thread here describing what they are But basically they start the thread off by saying shortly post merge lido and coinbase had produced just under 50 percent of ramblin Random sampling of 1k blocks excess concentration among eighth liquid liquid staking derivatives or lsd's is not on the market Or lsd's is not ideal for any decentralized protocol. It's not lido nor coinbase's fault that they're dominant. They offer great products It's the result of uneven distribution of use cases liquidity integrations, etc By acting now we can reduce lsd concentration and improve the health of ethereum dfi succeeds when it succeeds So they're introducing gravity which is an e centric borrowing protocol focused on fueling decentralization for ethereum It's inspired by liquid liquidy and gravity will allow holders of eth and lsd such as re st Etc to borrow in an interest-free and capital efficient way and by providing shared access to leverage and liquidity across lsd's We can reduce centralization risk for ethereum. So basically A tldr here is that they're trying to bring all the liquidity and of lsd's together So that it doesn't concentrate into any one lsd just for liquidity reason So for example, obviously st eth has a lot of liquidity because it has a lot of dominance within the ethereum staking space as opposed to something like Are eth and that means that liquidity, you know, we all know liquidity begets liquidity and it means that light St. It's dominance can go up because of that. So how do we reduce that? Well, there's a bunch of other ways that i've talked about before of how to reduce lido's dominance But i'm not going to go into that now How do we reduce it on the liquidity side of things? Well, we bring it all together in something like gravity protocol and we use Different mechanisms and the mechanisms are detailed. I believe in the thread and the blog post here to enable Uh shared liquidity across these things in order to basically say to users Hey, you don't have to worry about liquidity go with any stadium provider you want that's supported by this protocol Because we've got your back. That's my understanding of it if i'm wrong, please call me out on that but that's definitely how I understand it after reading the thread and uh, the uh, the The blog post here, but I think this is a cool idea I think if it can work, it's really it really is great and it really will encourage more decentralization on the lsd space Uh, and it's just another tool in our toolbox to essentially encourage decentralization on the ethereum core protocol layer Which is the whole point of uh, I guess like us doing anything, right? Like if we can't maintain decentralization of the base layer, then we can all pack up and go home But luckily there are so many different efforts happening across so many different parts of the ecosystem That i'm more confident than ever that we can actually make ethereum even more decentralized than it is today When I do consider it to still be extremely decentralized today Uh, and i'm and i'm very confident that we can fight off the centralization concerns Using all of these tools that we have today and the more that are coming out over time All right. So speaking of application specific roll-ups I came across this project called avo I don't know if that's how you pronounce it. But uh, i'm gonna say avo for from now on so basically this is an options App specific roll-up on that's being built on ethereum here and I believe The team behind ribbon finance is is working with avo or maybe even building avo themselves, but this is really cool Uh, they're calling it a next generation options exchange and this exchange is built from the ground up for pro traders With a high performance audible robust margining system daily weekly monthly and quarterly options built on a custom roll-up designed for scale So where dy dx is leaving ethereum right and going to cosmos Avo has come along and said well no we're going to stick on ethereum with roller with a custom roll-up And we're going to do an entire options exchange on here, which is very cool Now obviously dy dx is not an options exchange. They are derivatives exchange for for perpetuals products, but I do believe they want to Expand their horizons as well But I guess like avo wouldn't be directly competing with them once they go to cosmos But uh, that's a whole nother discussion but generally excited to see another roll-up guys like as I said before our specific roll-ups Are going to be a thing they're going to be huge but we need better infrastructure for people to be able to build them So we can get more of them It's obvious that the avo team here has just taken upon themselves to build their own custom roll-up but if we get the yes the stacker network vision here and We're basically going to have an easy way for people to just deploy roll-ups on the same infrastructure But make it their own they can configure it they can do things with it They can do whatever they want on it and then we'll get like a much more vibrant app specific roll-up ecosystem Which obviously I want to see I want to see thousands of these things proliferate and I think that it'll be really cool to have Obviously just a handful of the generalized roll-ups as i've talked about before there's not going to be many of those But I do believe there's going to be lots and lots of these app specific roll-ups because it just makes the most sense For a lot of these things but uh, yeah, you can check this out I'll link it in the youtube description below but I think on that note that's going to be it for today So thank everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give it a thumbs up Subscribe to the newsletter join the disco channel and i'll catch you all tomorrow.

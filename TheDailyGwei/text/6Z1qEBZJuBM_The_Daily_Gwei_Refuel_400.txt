 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily grey refuel where I kept the latest news in the theorem ecosystem I'm your host and this is hunter enters the 6th of july 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So so the sepolia testnet merge is happening very very soon It probably is in the middle of happening or already happened by the time You have watched this is of course going to be the live stream with the eat steak a crew and myself I'm sure by the time I think by the time this goes out It'll either be kind of like the end of the live stream or like maybe even halfway through it or something like that Um, but you can obviously watch the recording back Kind of like later on like after you've finished watching this or whatever, uh, and i'm super excited for it I mean, this is this is two-thirds of the way there guys like to to mainnet merge after sepolia is girly And that's it. And then we have mainnet like there's nothing else planned after that. Everything has gone through Quite smoothly so far no major issues in terms of like merge related issues or consensus related issues A lot of things seem to be just non-merge related and non-consensus related Which is what we want to see of course, and there's more shadow forks happening. I believe that shadow fork 8 went Through quite smoothly. I saw today. I think there was only an issue with eragon nodes uh, um, or I think that they weren't synced or something like that. I can't remember exactly what was said I read it in the um, The core dev I kind of like discord, but I think there was maybe uh, 10 15 of the network Which was the eragon nodes that were kind of like, um, not synced or something like that And then yeah, there wasn't any big merge related issues or anything like that, which is very awesome to see But yeah, if you want to keep up to date with I guess like the sepolia testnet merge and how it all went I guess like we'll know that it went through successfully or not You probably know by now by the time you're watching this but i'm sure there'll be post mortems and things like that and reports that come Out after maybe like 12 to 24 hours after it happens. I'm just super excited for it So I guess it's probably already happened by the time you watch this. So hopefully it went well All right, so xiaowei wang here from uh, the ethereum foundation has uploaded her presentations of the ethereum layer one rnd workshop At uh dev connect here so you can go to this forum here and the pro Presentations covered the most important rnd topics such as dank sharding pbs statelessness and more so This is the stuff that you want to be watching and kind of like Reading and kind of paying attention to If you want to get into like the deepest weeds of ethereum core protocol development This is the bleeding edge guys like this sort of stuff is is stuff that is years out, right? Like it's just kind of like in research phase right now And then obviously it'll move on keep iterating from there and then move on to development phase And then obviously hopefully it goes into the network and kind of becomes part of the main net ethereum But this kind of like stuff includes, you know, eip 4844, which is proto dank sharding I think sharding in general l2 resource pricing, right? Kind of like other things like statelessness as xiaowei wang mentioned and a bunch of other really really cool things here So if you're interested in kind of watching those talks and and and checking out the slides and everything I'll link this in the youtube description for you and you can check it out below All right, so speaking of the ethereum foundation the ef research team will host a reddit ama on july 7th at 1 p.m Utc this is about 24 hours after the sepolia testnet merge timing which I guess is the point right there They want to kind of like do this ama after a major kind of event has happened which was the sepolia testnet merge So if you have questions, definitely go to this thread i'll link in the youtube description below and you can ask your questions In the thread here. These ama's are usually really really good and really really full of insight They've done a bunch of these, you know as this is the eighth here They've done seven previous ones and they do them semi-regularly I think it happens maybe on a kind of like every five to six month cadence here as you can see from From the dates and it's just a really good way to ask the kind of like people on the bleeding edge of ethereum Any question that you would like and they're usually very very good about answering most of the questions If not, all of them that are asked in the thread So definitely go and ask your questions And of course once the ama is complete and they've answered all the questions you can go read all their answers Which i'm sure will be packed full of alpha There's no I mean there's really no one kind of like I guess deeper in the weeds than the ethereum foundation research Team in terms of kind of like ethereum core protocol development. This is where it starts guys like it doesn't start the development phase Obviously it starts at the research phase and everything has started there the proof of stake sharding Aip1559 like everything that you've ever kind of like heard of every major upgrade has started in the research phase Been iterated on over time and made its way into the network So if you paid attention since kind of like the research phase You got to basically see it evolve over time and see everything come together now Which is actually really cool i've paid attention to pretty much every major upgrade since I got into ethereum and from like the research Side to the development side and it's really really awesome to see Just how kind of I guess like how it all comes together right at the end of the day So yeah, check out this ama ask your own questions if you have them i'll link it in the youtube description below All right, so another I guess ethereum or web 3 related mobile phone user And I just saw this kind of like I guess a few hours ago and I hadn't heard of this before but basically This account called at ethereum phone has released a the first build of eth os which I guess stands for ethereum operating system And they're claiming that eth os is easy to install updates over the air features an onboard light node and you can install it on A pixel 3 or 5a i'm sure you I think you can install this on basically any modern android phone But if you go to ethereum phone.org, basically what you'll see here is Kind of like the kind of link to install it yourself here So a mobile operating system built to be crypto native And this is kind of like the features that they that they're planning on kind of like having or adding so native dapps Uh zero percent platform fees crypto widgets a local light node I talked about light clients the other day and light nodes crypto native payments and an ens integration as well I'm sure you can see that I'm sure among other features now what this is basically an Like a whole new operating system for your phone obviously stuff like this can't really be installed on iphones I'm, not even sure if like people even bother jailbreaking iphones these days It seems to be a much smaller community than it once was but android It's uh, it used to be called like rooting your android phone Which was basically getting kind of like root access to the phone in order to upload or install your own Operating system on it. Well, that's kind of like the whole thing Operating system on it. Well, that's exactly what um, aethos is trying to do here, which is I think pretty cool I discussed yesterday about you know polygon partnering with htc on their metaverse phone and obviously salana has their own phone initiative and things Like that. I think there is definitely going to be a battle here And and there's definitely going to be something that comes out of it as I mentioned yesterday. I am way less bullish I'm, actually pretty bearish on teams that are trying to do their own hardware. Um, even if they're working with a third third party it's kind of like You know, it's kind of hard to do hardware Just generally, but also I think that if you do software It means you can kind of like install it on the existing devices that are already out there the existing hardware That's already out there now Obviously ethereum os is taking it to the extreme where you can install an entirely new os on the phone In order to get like a mobile for I mean, sorry crypto first mobile or crypto native mobile experience Which I guess most people aren't going to do but like maybe the more hardcore people will do And also just a note on that as well. I haven't looked at this software I don't know anyone who has so I don't know if it's kind of like legit or if it has a backdoor in it or whatever So I wouldn't be storing any significant funds on this or anything just yet I wouldn't be putting much money into it at all But if you do want to try it out you can of course But I guess um, that's just like an aside to what I was just saying before But I think you know the software side of things is going to be much more impactful than the hardware side And it doesn't have to be an entirely new os. It can be specific apps. It can be specific integrations with existing Software, I mean android itself and and and it's and the popular flavors of android like that the manufacturers put on it Such as samsung can embed their own crypto wallet and i'm pretty sure samsung did at one point I'm, not sure what happened with that and same with kind of like apple that can embed things into apple pay I think they did or they were looking at it they can embed things directly into the iphone because the iphone has a So basically what the iphone has is essentially what kind of like a hardware wallet has where it has a separate Kind of um chip for all your I guess passwords and authentication and things like that So you can technically have a private key that lives on that chip and no one would be able to see that and you'll be able To use your mobile device as kind of like a web free wallet like natively without having to install a different kind of like Wallet software on it so all that sorts of stuff is really cool But again obviously it relies on apple integrating that at the ios level and it would require one of the manufacturers or android itself Doing it on the on the um kind of like os level or you could install ether os and It's all there for you and the good cool thing about android is that you can install these custom os's and still have access to The app store like the google play store you can still install and still install the apps from it The only issue is that you know the compatibility issues between these new os and the apps that you install and things like that So that's definitely a potential blocker there but still cool to see people experimenting with this I mean this sort of stuff has been talked about for a while now like Like i'd have to be five or six years at this point In terms of having like a web 3 phone or web 3 operating system and there's been various attempts over time And I think it really comes down to the fact that we just need more experiments in the ecosystem We just need more people kind of I guess like giving it a go but I think that The success is if if it's ever if there's going to be success here It's it's just going to be seen on the software layer I don't think there's going to be much success on the on the kind of like hardware layer Because as I described yesterday or as I explained yesterday The hardware game is like totally different to the software game. It's it's it's very very much very very hard And not just hard from kind of like a supply chain perspective, but also just building the network effect Breaking even you know cost efficiency all that stuff that I that I mentioned yesterday there But just wanted to kind of like highlight this today because I thought it was interesting And as I said, you can go install this I mean you could install this on some just like cheap android phone if you just wanted to play around with that if you didn't Want to screw around with your own android phone and replace your existing os You can essentially just install this on a really cheap android phone that you could probably get off amazon or ebay or something like that And play around with it or I think you could even install it on like an emulator an android emulator On on your pc as well if you wanted to play around with it But as I said, I wouldn't be using this as a daily driver yet And I also wouldn't be storing any significant amount of money in this because you just can't trust it at this point because I Just saw it. I don't know much about it. So I can't be recommending it to to you guys yet But I just thought it was interesting To to see that this is out there All right, so bar tech from the l2b team has published a proposal on the l2 Beat a forum for a bridge at risk framework So they obviously want to get community feedback on this framework and it's been something that they've been working on for quite a while now I remember talking about it when they were teasing it Basically, they want to do what they did for our layer twos in general on l2 beats for bridges in terms of getting a risk Framework up and running making users aware of kind of like the Trade-offs of each bridge how they work what the risks are, you know, are they admin keys? Are they centralized controls all these sorts of stuff and I think it's an awesome effort that needs to kind of like be done because obviously bridges are very very popular these days and they're only getting more popular As time goes on but not all bridges are created equal pretty much all of them have major differences between each other And I think people some people kind of like equate bridges with each other like oh You know this bridge lets me do this and this bridge lets me do this and this bridge lets me do this and this bridge lets me do that As well, they must be the same thing when in reality different bridges work in different ways Like I've spoken extensively about bridges before right? There's kind of like cross chain or cross l2 exchanges which act as kind of like bridges and then there's just simply kind of like sending it across and There's kind of like a system that just like signs the transactions and issues you iou's on different chains and they may be controlled by Multisigs and stuff like that. So there are various different bridge designs out there And that's I think what the l2 bridge risk framework wants to do is that they want to centralize they want to centralize the information around all these bridges into one easy to digest kind of like Resource for people so that people know exactly what they're kind of like getting into and you can actually see the different kind of like Messaging bridges they call them here You know in more detail such as kind of like light client verifying external validator set optimistic validation and hybrid so This post itself is actually pretty informative If you want to learn about a little more about bridges, I would highly recommend checking it out but also get involved with the conversation if you have any kind of like Any kind of uh thoughts on this as well and actually I didn't I didn't see this just before but there seems to be a table here with all of the bridges or at least all the known bridges and kind of like what they're using for Verification their mechanism and the trusted entities and the trust assumptions. This is really cool This is exactly what the framework will end up looking like probably in a nicer format But essentially what you see on my screen here where you see different kind of bridges such as you know The binance smart chain bridge from ethereum to bsc is is verification is done externally It's lock and mint which means lock it on ethereum and you get issued an iou or minted an iou on bsc It has an external validator set that you have to trust which is the bsc validator sets And then the same is true for a lot of these things here and then you can see kind of like these Generalized bridges that we've used such as hop and connects Verification is done locally on hop mechanism is liquidity providers So it's that kind of decentralized exchange that I was talking about and the trusted entities is obviously liquidity here And you can see all the different ones i'm not going to read through them all but this is I think a really really cool Little table here that will actually save you a lot of time and effort and and worry kind of know trying to Kind of like figure out what the bridge is how they secured what you know what the risk is all that sorts of stuff So I can't really tell you what the risk is I can't really tell you what the risk is how they secured what you know what the risk is all that sorts of stuff So I can't wait to see this live on the l2b website I think this is going to be an amazing resource for people just like I think that the l2b website in general is an amazing resource of people because it lets you know the risks and I talk about the risks a lot on the refuel around everything not just decentralized things not just d5 But obviously cify and centralized services and stuff like that like at the end of the day I'm not going to be putting any significant amount of money into something that I didn't know how it worked I used to do it when I was more of a cowboy in d5 summer like I was a bit harder and looser there But I've definitely kind of like Matured since then and definitely taken risk a lot more seriously and now when I look at something I kind of like hesitate I'm like, do I really want to put my money into this thing? Like how much do I trust it and it's you know I'm not kind of like aping my funds into fresh yield farms anymore Not that there really is anything like that at the moment, but just generally i'm not doing that like i'll go If i'm doing something i'll put it into a protocol that I know is kind of very secure I've been around for a while Has a team that's not going to rug or anything like that such as kind of like uniswap or or maker Or curve compound are there, you know all the popular ones, right? Those are the kind of things that I would probably put my money into Uh, if I if I was going to use something like defi on chain But there are a lot of stuff out there that I just wouldn't touch and especially when it comes to bridges as well. I don't Really like bridging into different things and bridging out of it using these third-party bridges at this stage Just because of the fact that they're very early there's still risks involved Um, and if I was doing a significant value transfer Then I definitely would not be using any bridge like if I was going from ethereum layer one to optimism and I wanted to transfer Significant is relative like it, you know Obviously a thousand dollars is more significant to some person than than other people But say I wanted to transfer a ten thousand dollars or something to the optimism from ethereum layer one I would personally go through the optimism bridge itself. Uh, the bridge contract I wouldn't go through one of these third parties and same is true for going back now I know there's that seven day delay when you go through the the um, the kind of like natural bridge there But I would account for that out. So the native bridge there, but I would account for that personally and it just depends Obviously as I said the amount is relative, but these bridges will become more secure over time They'll become more trustless. They'll become they'll have less centralized points of failure, but we're not there yet Obviously all this stuff is very early and that's why we need things like the bridge risk framework here In order to enable users to know exactly what the risks are that they're taking. So check this out I'll link in the youtube description below So awoki shared some really cool stats here from gitcoin So in q2 of 2022 gitcoin facilitated for 9.4 million dollars in value transfer across a bunch of different categories here bounties tips grants kudos ads and ecosystem Now obviously the top two is uh kind of like ground grants and uh, and I think tips These colors are kind of like weird here. It's either tips or bounties. Uh, these colors are all very similar on On my screen. It's it's it's kind of like weird to see but um grants obviously is accounted for like the major I guess like revenue of of gitcoin, uh, or I guess like the main kind of like value transfer I shouldn't say revenue value transfer of gitcoin for a long time now But it seems that I think that's tips because it's I think bounties is in is in a darker color here But it seems like I I don't know for sure But it seems that tips or bounties is accounting for about half and grants is accounting for about half now as well Which is cool. I mean, it means there's more diversity in the value transfer here on gitcoin It's not just all centralized in grants. We obviously don't want it to just be mostly grants We want gitcoin to be more than than the grants rounds. Sorry than the grants Thing, uh grants product in general. We want gitcoin to fund open source software as much as it can and you can see here In total there's been 65 million dollars of funding for open source software I mean that's huge guys like there like open source software is usually something that gets very very underfunded or not funded at all And there are many many instances of very very popular open source products and open source software products And and um and kind of like a code in general that has been used by major companies, you know billion Billion trillion dollar companies and these companies don't actually pay anything and don't maintain these sorts of things and don't kind of like Pay the people that are maintaining this software. They just use it because it's something very popular to use Uh, and then what happens up happening is that the the developers or the maintainers of that? Software may be like well, I don't want to maintain this anymore Like I they have no obligation to and then uh, some people kind of like or some companies like oh crap We actually need this we really need this and then they kind of like have their shit moment Whereas doing a more sustainable kind of like way of funding open source software, which is what get coins mission is He's definitely much much much better because it basically pays people for doing the work and for maintaining things and for Kind of awarding them for their important work the things that people care about Uh, you know, there's a lot of kind of like teams a lot of projects on gitcoin grants these days But I think the classic example is the ethereum core teams, right? They get money from various different sources but generally they need to kind of like find their own funding and grants is one way to do that and they're providing a shit ton of value for the network like They're building the things that drive value directly to eat. I mean they built one five five nine That's driving the right value directly to eat. They're doing the merge which is obviously very bullish for eath So they should be paid for their work in and and I think honestly like that payment could come from the ethereum foundation Which already pays them and other entities but I think it's really cool that individuals get to have an impact here especially in the matching rounds where they can basically Give like one to ten dollars and have that matched a lot more and have their donation go a lot A lot further than it otherwise would have to public, you know, open source software here So very very cool to see gitcoin having such amazing growth. Uh, I hope it continues All right, so a tweet from polly now today, I don't think i've um talked about polly in a little while I remember there was a time where I think for like a whole week on every refuel I had polly now tweets up But uh, they're not tweeting as much these days, but whenever they do it's always a banger So they put out another one today where they said endgame Evm, slash vm asics for roll-up sequences orders of magnitude faster versus any multi-threaded virtual machine Stateless and expiring multiple sequences composing to a single validity proof roll-up and users and validators verify validity proofs on CPU without requiring requiring recomputation on asics Okay, this sort of stuff is like getting into the very nitty-gritty of uh, I guess like layer twos or validity proof roll-ups As as kind of like polly now calls them here But essentially what they are saying is that the the end game like long into the future Or maybe not too long into the future but kind of like over the longer term We definitely want to see asics repurposed to become roll-up sequences So what they would do as a roll-up sequencer is that they kind of like run these proofs, you know The most expensive part most time-consuming part of a validity proof roll-up or a zk roll-up is the proving costs and the proving time Now to get that down you can use things like asics, the application specific integrated circuits Which is what is used obviously in proof of work today, but using them as a sequencer doesn't require you to burn Enormous amounts of electricity because it's a different thing in proof of work. You're basically Competing in like a worldwide lottery and guessing kind of and like hashing to guess the the right kind of like, uh, uh, right Get guess the right guess I guess you'll guess the right guy right thing that you need to kind of like produce a block there But basically as as a sequencer, it's not doing any of that sorts of stuff It's just processing the kind of like, um transactions and and and running the proof and all that sorts of stuff there So obviously there's no massive electricity cost here So I think that's really cool that we can repurpose asics hopefully in the future Hopefully or kind of like have the asic manufacturers kind of build asics for zk wireless for validity proof roll-ups and then doing multiple sequences composing to a Single validity proof roll-up would be very cool as well and then users users and validators verify the validity proofs on their own CPU Without re without requiring recomputation on ASIC So basically the ASIC does all the heavy lifting and then the CPU from any device smartphone laptop PC It doesn't matter what it is would be able to verify the validity of these proofs. So verify that they're correct Without having to do the whole computation themselves without having to do the intensive work themselves So as I said, this sort of stuff is very technical down in the weeds Like i'm not going to say i'm an expert on this far from it But I think this is stuff that you can look into if you're into the hardware side of crypto If you want to know what the future of asics looks like Especially in the ethereum ecosystem, obviously asic miners are still going to exist within bitcoin They're not changing for proof of work for a while if ever I say for a while because I do think there is a reality where they do have a proof of stake Bitcoin it may be a fork it may not be the bitcoin but I Think that it could happen eventually but just generally asics are still going to be bitcoin You know a bitcoin thing is going to be for bitcoin proof of work But they're also going to be a roll-up thing Specifically with zk roll-ups that have very high proving costs and take a long time By by putting an asic to it. We could get those costs dramatically down in the time also down dramatically there So yeah, that's it on that one. You can go check out the thread I think that there's not really many replies here But there are there's another thread links here about recursive snarks if you wanted to read that as well All right, so uh voyage are the troubled kind of like crypto services or centralized crypto service provider Today, kind of like put out a thread or at least a ceo Steven or stephanie i put out a thread talking about what the recovery plan is for voyager So there's one tweet in particular that I wanted to focus on and for those of you who don't know voyager basically Bankrupt themselves by lending out I think 600 million dollars or something to three hours capital Obviously didn't get that paid back because three hours capital blew themselves up and I think voyager has like 200 250 million dollars With of assets left so unfortunately customers took the hit here and I quote tweeted this tweet and this is the tweet that Stephen or stephen put out here where he says Customers with crypto in their accounts will receive in exchange a combination of the crypto in their accounts Proceeds from the three hours capital recovery common shares in the newly reorganized company and voyager tokens So basically the the loss is being socialized to the customers of voyager which really really sucks Like and that's why I said like I feel very sorry for voyager customers This is fucked up just another reminder to not leave any funds you care about on centralized exchanges Services, uh, don't do it guys like honestly not your keys not your coins I know that's been around forever, but it's so true. Like if you had left your funds in voyager You are now basically getting this. I don't know what another word for it this orgy of kind of like crap basically like You get some of the crypto in your account You get some of the proceeds from the three hours capital recovery if that ever comes you get common shares in the newly Reorganized company which would probably not be worth very much and you get some voyager tokens Which again aren't worth very much because they're all dumped because of the fact that the news came out the voyager kind of like screwed themselves I really hate this and like the reason I hate this is because at the end of the day like customers and users Most of if not all of them are pretty much all of them are innocent They shouldn't be taking the I guess like a brunt of this so they shouldn't be taking the punishment here But the problem is a voyager literally doesn't have the money to cover all their obligations to their customers So they have to do this. So that's why don't keep any significant funds on these centralized services or exchanges There is a spectrum here obviously voyager is very different to something like a coinbase But at the end of the day like it doesn't matter who it is if you don't control your keys You don't control your coins like it doesn't matter how trustworthy the the the person is or the organization is that hold your crypto for you That doesn't matter at all like unless you control your own fate you're at the whims of them and the same is true for like banks And stuff too like if you put your money in a bank and there's been instances of this around the world Put your money in a bank and the bank starts having troubles or the economy or the government starts having troubles or there's like Rampant inflation or there's a bank run like you there's no guarantee you have access to your you'll get access to your funds, right? So it's not just a crypto thing It's just a general thing and we have this beautiful thing of self self self sovereignty or being as a Well to kind of hold your own money and being able to self custody and people take take that for granted people put their money into the essentialized services to earn some yield they're like Oh, I can earn like 10% on my stable coins or 10% on my or 5% on my ethan bitcoin and it's like okay Well, yeah, you can earn that but then you have a hundred percent chance of risks of custodial risk Which is basically this this kind of like organization can go run away with your funds go bankrupt get hacked Any of that sorts of stuff whereas with self custody? I don't actually think it's very it's difficult to self custody at all I mean like there are different ways to do it Even just self custody on a hot wallet is probably better than putting it on a centralized exchange At least most of these centralized exchanges and services. But again, it is a spectrum. I mean hot wallets themselves are inherently insecure, too so i'm not trying to say that they're secure but in my mind like a Most of these centralized exchanges and services are more risky than that and that's saying something right if it's more risky than a hot wallet Then it must be very very risky Whereas there is obviously cold wallets and cold storage and hardware wallets and all that sorts of stuff that you can do as well a little bit more complicated For the everyday user but like come on like does it like if you can't be bothered learning how to use a hardware wallet or learning How to kind of like get your funds onto a hardware wallet and you have a significant amount of money in crypto Well, then honestly, I just think that's that's pure laziness because if you don't care enough to secure your funds if you're fine risking your funds On these centralized services, that's totally your decision But at the end of the day if you just took a little bit of time to learn how to self custody and learn the importance of That you would have said you would potentially save yourself so much heartache down the line So I think in the future, I really hope that more people kind of like heed these warnings more people kind of like Realize these sorts of stuff. Maybe they weren't probably they weren't and I think really at the end of the day What's coming to these centralized exchanges and services is extremely harsh regulation It's probably gonna be just as harsh as what banks have if not harsher than that And that's what's gonna kind of like curb this sort of stuff. There's gonna be obviously audits and stuff There's gonna be regulations applied to these companies and all that sorts of stuff there as well But just generally I would prefer if we just kind of like had people who are like custody their own funds and I controlled their own keys, but I know that that may not be a scalable way for mass adoption either But it can be if we get better solutions Obviously something like a smart contract while that that argent's working on where you can have like um A social recovery and stuff like that like that definitely is getting us better towards the path of of enabling More and more people to self custody and for them to do it easily But just in general, I mean if you're listening to the refuel like I said before You're in the weeds to me all the refuel listeners and watchers are in the weeds of crypto or ethereum everything that has to do with That if you have any significant amount of money Not in a hardware wallet like just literally go buy one right now like go buy a lattice one go buy a ledger Whatever hardware hardware wallet you want Go buy one and then move your crypto to it And make sure you secure it obviously properly and secure your seed phrase properly and everything like that because you know Like it starts with us guys like it starts with the enthusiast at the end of the day and then we can kind of like Put that message out there and and educate other people about it as well But yeah, very very I feel very sorry as I said for voyager customers here And it was avoidable for them if they didn't have their funds there But unfortunately voyager just doesn't have the money to pay everyone back. So there's really nothing they can do At the end of the day, but they are trying to push some blame onto kind of 3i's capital here with this tweet Which I thought was funny as well, but they're not really that good at all They're just trying to push some blame onto kind of 3i's capital here with this tweet, which I thought was funny as well But they're solely to blame here voyager the company for lending out all that money in an under collateralized fashion or an unclar Alized fashion to 3i's capital was absolute stupidity really really dumb Not even in just in hindsight just generally even if 3i's capital was legit lending out that much money to of your balance sheet to and in an unclar Kind of like a fund that you know trades it is just stupid in my eyes, but I think that was just kind of like One of the ways that voyager was was kind of like offering the yield to their customers because 3i's capital would have been like Oh, yeah Yeah We'll pay you You know this amount of kind of like interest on this and then they can't like pass it to their customers and promised all this Yield and all that kind of like other stuff. But yeah, not pretty feel sorry for people there But but yeah, I think that's it for for that one there and I think that's it for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel If you haven't yet get a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the disco channel and i'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone

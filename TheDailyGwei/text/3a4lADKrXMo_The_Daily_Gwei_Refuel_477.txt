 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the DeliGray Refuel where we cap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host Dan Nysa signing into the 28th of October 2022. Alright everyone let's get into it. So the Allcore devs call, the first one in a few weeks actually happened yesterday or today I should say and we have an update thread here from Tim Byker which of course I'll link in the YouTube description below but someone has already done my job job for me on Twitter here, Oyrukemono, I think that's how you say that name there but they basically summarized the call or at least like the main points of focus on the call. So one of the obviously big points of focus was withdrawals and as noted here everyone being the core devs is fully on board for withdrawals to be included and for the release to be ASAP. And then obviously the next biggest upgrade on the list was 4844s, you know proto-dank sharding and for the first time we heard a core dev make a prediction on the Shanghai hard fork without 4844. Marius speculated end of February which is exactly I guess like what I've been saying as well you know that first half of 2023 but maybe towards late Q1 which March is basically getting into into late Q1 there, end of Feb maybe considered still kind of like mid to late there. But yeah I mean it just depends right like I've said it before a lot of times that 4844 is being worked on but if it's not ready in time for like the test nets for example as noted here as well you know multiple execution layer teams including Geth said that the amount of remaining work they have to do for 4844 is not that great but the consensus layer teams tended to be more non-committal because there's more work to do on that side for them. In any event it was not intended to decide in or out on this call rather it just confirmed the informal consensus that has emerged in recent weeks for everybody to keep working on it full speed and maybe around end of November it'll all be clear whether it will be ready in time to catch the train to Shanghai when it starts to leave the station in January. So I guess in January we're expecting Shanghai test nets and if 4844 isn't ready by then it's probably not going to end up in Shanghai we'll probably just end up having withdrawals and maybe a few other EIPs but probably not 4844. So I'm still hopeful I'm still hopeful that we can get there in time for January but it is a bit difficult to tell because obviously December and in January are holiday periods we don't know who's going to be on deck and who's not during that time and we shouldn't expect them you know the core devs to be on deck during the holiday period anyway they've got families they want to spend time with and all that stuff but generally yeah if 4844 isn't ready by January it's not going into a test net and as was noted here we'll probably know by end of November anyway because the core devs will have a good idea of whether they can get it ready in time for those test nets that are going live but withdrawals definitely 100% going to be in Shanghai obviously every core dev wants that to happen and everyone in the community wants that to happen it is the next big milestone besides 4844 on the ethereum roadmap and it's funny that I say that because some other communities will make fun of ethereum saying you know withdrawals should have been with staking from day one but in the context of how ethereum's proof of stake rollout has gone there's a very good reason withdrawals weren't there from day one right I mean we started off with just a standalone beacon chain network that was a one-way bridge you weren't able to withdraw from that because it was a separate network and then we merged and we wanted to keep that as simple as possible we didn't want to introduce anything that could break the merge and obviously that was a good decision because we had a pretty perfect marriage right and now shortly after the merge we are getting withdrawals in and you know at the end of the day no one's forced to stake and everyone knows like when you go through the staking process as a solo staker and you know actually sending e to the deposit contract you are warned that you aren't able to withdraw and even with the lsd's I think a lot of them warn you and say that you won't be able to actually withdraw from the the bigger chain itself you have to actually sell it on secondary market and you may not get the exact value as we've seen previously these lsd tokens can quote unquote de-peg from their you know true value and I think people are understand that so and the people who are staking with exchanges as I said they have ways to exit they can go through cb eth or I mean st obviously lido is not an exchange but they've got ways to exit there but in terms of solo stakers withdrawing uh that just can't happen right uh right now and obviously that'll happen in in a few months um and on top of that as well the block awards are not withdrawable either oh the only rewards that are withdrawable are the mev uh rewards and the fee revenue um because those are execution layer rewards but anything happening on the consensus layer such as rewards for attesting proposing blocks and being part of a sync committee that is going to be available when beacon chain withdrawals are enabled as well as being able to withdraw that 32th per validator principle that you have if you have a validator spun up and that brings me to us to another concern that people often bring up is that oh you know when withdrawals are enabled how many people are actually going to withdraw eith you know unstake eith and sell it well I think I've said this before on the refill but just to refresh you are I think we can be relatively certain that at least the rewards like not the principle not the 32th principle but all the rewards that have um been accrued to this point or at least most of them that have been accrued till this point I think maybe 50 percent of them uh uh you know around 50 percent will probably be sold off for tax purposes because uh staking is taxable as income in a lot of places and obviously you haven't been able to uh get your eith out to sell it to cover that tax so maybe people have covered it on their own or haven't reported it yet but they're gonna have to pay that tax so I can I can have felt fair certainty that around 50 percent of uh the of most of the rewards that have been accrued today will probably be sold maybe anywhere from 30 to 50 percent um you know it's kind of hard to tell but there is going to be some portion now that's on the reward side of things what about the principle well I think it really depends what the price of eith is because if eith is the price it is now and when and the deposit contract went live when eith was around five six six hundred dollars you know how many people are actually going to be wanting to take profits at that point and you're just up over 2x on your eith you know if you've been in it for this long are you just going to sell when the price is you know at the price that it is now I don't know I don't think many people are going to do that and we've seen tons of people entering staking over the last year or so uh and how many are then are going to sell I mean a lot of them are probably underwater at this point are they going to sell I don't know it's it's it's very hard to tell there's a lot of speculation that goes into this but I think that I don't I think that's going to be a quite a fun event to see because people are going to assume that any eith withdrawn from staking is going to be sold and I don't think that's the case as I've discussed before I expect us to have this great reshuffling event where basically there's going to be eith actually withdrawn from centralized exchanges and lsd's and put into maybe you know decentralized providers like rocker pool and stakewise v3 uh and also uh you know uh solar staking right so we're gonna have to say it's gonna take months to play out because of the the exit queue as well I mean you can't just like not all the eith can just exit at once there's a certain there's a queue and obviously that queue varies depending on how many validators are staking uh so how many validators are online I should say uh but nonetheless it's going to be very interesting I'm looking forward to withdrawals even though it seems like such a minor upgrade I think if you really dig into it it's a huge upgrade it has huge implications for the network and not just on the I guess um uh speculative side of things but also on the censorship side of things too as I've been discussing a lot lately where I think that withdrawals are going to help with that and you know to play devil's advocate it could also make it worse it could be you know people could say oh well screw solar staking I'm going to just put my eith in coinbase or binance or another centralized provider and stake with them I don't really think that's going to be the case I haven't seen any solar stakeholders I haven't talked to any solar stakeholders that have ever even like alluded or hinted at that so I don't think that's going to be the case but at the same time we don't we can't know for sure until withdrawals actually happens but thankfully withdrawals are coming uh you know mid to late q1 maybe pushing into q2 uh but they're definitely coming as part of the shanghai upgrade 48 44 jury is still out but we'll know more I guess towards the end of november and I'll keep you guys updated on that one all right so a big piece of news out of google over the last 24 hours so google cloud has announced blockchain node services starting with ethereum so basically you could spin up an ethereum node with relative ease using google cloud which I think is pretty cool I think you know some people say that this is just further centralizing ethereum but I don't actually agree with that I think it makes it more decentralized because right now a lot of people are running ethereum nodes on aws for example now google cloud is just another player in the game which means by definition it's making it more decentralized because people have more options and more places to to stake google cloud does not run on aws as far as I know it's there it's google's own servers and google and amazon are separate companies so by the very definition that's more decentralized than just people running their um their nodes on aws or amazon so I thought that was pretty cool and the block has a good coverage of this that you can check out in the youtube description below but speaking of nodes and node distribution there is a couple of websites you can go to so there's node watch that I've highlighted before dot io which tracks consensus layer on nodes but like because consensus layer and execution layer nodes both need to be run to have a full ethereum node you can have relative confidence that they're that they're around the same here and and I'll bring up ethernodes.org as well because this tracks execution layer node so there's about 8 000 on ether nodes of full ethereum nodes that's including obviously the consensus and execution layer clients and you can see here there's 13 600 on node watch but that is not synced so you can see there's only a percentage that is synced which is 66 percent now if I do my quick math here it should get us to around the same number uh 8976 yeah so it's off by around 900 as opposed to ethernodes.org but these numbers are only I guess like best guesses or guesstimates they're not totally accurate they're not going to show 100 percent view of the network they're definitely only estimates but let's just take ethernodes.org at 8 000 here so we can see that geth is obviously a large part of that so 80 percent of it then you've got the other ones eragon nethermine besu which are minority clients which are less there then you know we're not interested in client diversity for the sake of what I'm talking about here we're interested in where these nodes are actually hosted now I don't believe ethernodes.org has that they have the country uh kind of metric here which shows you where which countries they're hosted in so 45 are in the united states 12 in germany 5 in singapore and so on and so forth whereas node watch does so node watch will show you uh where these are if these are hosted or unhosted nodes and I believe where is where is uh hosted here we go so percentage of hosted nodes and percentage of non-hosted nodes so there's 26 hosted and 74 non-hosted again take these numbers with a grain of salt I've seen them higher from other estimates I think the highest I may have seen them is like 40 percent or maybe even 50 percent and hosted just means on one of these services such as google cloud or aws right but still like there's a few there's actually two major things to consider here one uh I don't think people using these hosting services for nodes actually is a big deal I don't think it like has a huge influence on the decentralization of the network because for example if 50 let's just say 50 of full nodes was hosted on aws and amazon said one day well screw you guys we're kicking you off right and the 50 of full nodes on the ethereum network would be kicked off well that does that prevent anyone from spinning up their full node on their own hardware no and you can do that because ethereum has prioritized uh the ease of spinning up a full node on consumer hardware that's the whole point of why ethereum is so limited at the base layer so I don't think it's a huge deal and I think people making it out to be a huge deal are looking at the nuance here but also on top of that I think that when looking at the different services that are available they're also based in different countries there isn't just like aws and google cloud but there are a bunch of other hosting services that you can use as well obviously you know given a lot of nodes are hosted in the united states a lot of them are going to be hosted on aws and and potentially google cloud as well or any other us based cloud providers but again it goes back to my argument where I said that even if 50 percent were shut down uh it doesn't really matter because you could just re-sync your full node using the other 50 of the network on your consumer hardware and you could even go with even more crazy numbers you could say that even if 90 of full nodes were offline it wouldn't even be that big of a deal obviously you know the higher you go the more impact it has but generally I think that it's overblown because it's not like a validator right it's not like where for example if amazon wanted to they could take control of all the validators list that are hosted on aws and actually have influence on the network a full node uh you know is really just there for you to verify the state of the network yourself and to obviously relay your transactions of and use your node as an rpc for example but it doesn't actually have uh validator it's not a validator right it's not the same thing it doesn't have influence to attest and propose blocks whereas for example if um aws hosted you know what whatever it is 67 percent if you want to go in the extreme case of validators which it doesn't but let's go to the extreme case uh it doesn't even have anywhere close to that amazon could take those over and then uh do basically take over the entire ethereum network but i don't think that people are going to do that because of the fact of the matter is that running a validator is more intensive it probably especially if you're running that many validators on there and there are uh there are definitely incentives not to do that because you could as i said like if you if amazon had that much of the um the network they could in theory take over the network but they're only taking over the network on the technical side of things the community could still fork them out so you could imagine it'd be messy and i'm getting into like really um weird territory right now but it would get messy but you could imagine an event where all those validators were hosted on on aws they get slashed right because the community comes together and says hey like that's not the real chain this is the real ethereum chain uh and the ecosystem maybe goes with that but it would be extremely messy because that those 67 of validators on and aws obviously belong to a lot of different people there'd be a lot of eth lost it'd be really bad and that's why it's encouraged not to have these validators on on any of these you know services and centralize around them but uh but yeah anyway that's a few tangents there but great to see that google cloud is supporting uh ethereum as its first blockchain node service here all right so speaking of decentralizing ethereum staking uh stakewise v3 or statewide put out a blog post around uh the migration to statewide v3 and as i say inside you will find the full scope of changes that are coming to the exit to the existing product as we transition to statewide v3 now you can check out this blog post it's about an eight minute read but it basically as i said describes the transition from statewide v2 to v3 now the reason why i i highlight this is because statewide v3 as i explained a few weeks ago is trying to become more like a rocker pool and less like a lighter for example right they're trying to be more decentralized basically uh and they're going to be taking advantage of dvt or distributed validated technology um from from what i uh from what i know uh yeah here we go you you've got it here so statewide v2 currently acts as a as like this right there is a statewide pool it goes to a bunch of different operators in statewide v3 there is going to be a genesis vault then they're going to be public operators with obel or ssv for dvt no collateral slashing cover and uh these are going to be different vaults right then the vaults are going to have different scores so there'll be risks or scores attached to them so very very cool uh you can read the full blog post i'll link it in the youtube description below i i recommend reading it because it's just great to see that another staking provider is making moves towards being more decentralized all right so consensus has announced the launch of the meta mask grants dow today which is an employee-led consensus funding program program that issues grants to the developers building impactful experience within the meta mask ecosystem now for those of you who don't know consensus actually owns meta mask as uh i mean as an app basically it came out of consensus it's been with consensus since day one and they still own it uh and they still fund it and everything like that obviously now uh you can build with these grants uh basically you'll be able to get involved uh if you're a developer if you want to build something in the meta mask ecosystem and uh there'll be i think uh six hundred thousand dollars per quarter up for grabs that's a huge i hadn't read that yet that's actually a huge allocation uh for just meta mask grants right that's uh 2.4 million dollars if i'm doing math correctly uh a year there uh for to find meaningful projects so yeah if you are interested in building something in the meta mask ecosystem this is a absolutely amazing opportunity honestly that's a lot of as i said like i didn't expect it to be that high usually these grants programs are quite small but uh i guess like consensus recently raised as well so they've got some money to to splash around here and obviously meta mask is incredibly important to the ethereum ecosystem and actually beyond the ethereum ecosystem as well because meta mask powers all the evm uh change you can use all of them you can change your network you know we've all done that uh before but yeah very very cool to see such a large amount of money allocated to this so yeah go check out this blog post for a breakdown of what this is and how you can get involved uh it's one for the developers out there all right a couple of optimism updates to get through uh quicks the optimism nft marketplace has announced that they've teamed up with layer 3 to launch an nft bridging quest and reward users for bridging the eighth their eighth nfts to optimism now i remember i spoke about this a little while ago that quicks now has a bridge so you can bridge your ethereum layer 1 nfts to optimism in order to take advantage of those cheaper fees and faster transactions well now they've teamed up with layer 3 to make this much easier for for you so you can see here that users who bridge an nft can earn up to 400 xp on layer 3 and those who bridge an nft from one of our pre-approved collection will receive an additional 25 op tokens per nft bridge from that collection and you can see the full list of pre-approved collections at this um at this kind of notion site here now i'm loading it up uh it's going to it the the quicks picks are things like uh crypto covens chain runners uh roboto's pudgy penguins and a few others there uh some trending on ethereum as well um and and a bunch of others as well here so uh these are the pre-approved collections right now i i assume that's going to keep growing but yeah if you're really into nfts and uh you want to try this out definitely do so i'll link it in the description below for you to check out uh and the second optimism update is that optimism has launched an op craft creator contest so you can create content around build structures in and hack on op craft for up to 31 000 in op bounties now i talked about op craft last week or the week before that's that game running on a op stack chain fully on chain it's basically a minecraft clone and i played around with it on the refill i'm sure you guys remember it uh but yeah this is really cool so for more info on this including submission instructions it can be found at the op craft dash contest channel on the optimism discord which you can join here with the link that i'll link in the youtube description below but yeah just more op tokens up for grabs if you've been involved with op craft lately you've been playing it a lot more than i have probably then definitely go check these out to potentially earn some rewards here all right so uniswap labs has posted a blog post all around all about uniswap v3 twop oracles in a proof of stake world now i've talked about twop oracles before on the refill twop basically stands for time weighted average price and the reason why uniswap v3 is such a great uh twop oracle is because it is fully on chain there's no need to rely on any external data you basically just take the price of say eth from uh uniswap using the pooling there you average it out over time as twop suggests and then that's the oracle price that gets fed into whatever you want to feed it into now with the advent of proof of stake on ethereum uh with the merge this has become not very secure uh because of the fact that uh or the risk of uh the implications of multi-block mev uh why and other such attacks now a refresher here for those who don't remember with ethereum proof of stake the um the next proposer for basically the entire uh epic is known uh for for sorry each proposer for the entire epic is known which basically means you know which validator is going to propose a block ahead of time now because of this it leads itself to what's called multi-block mev where basically if you know that you're going to propose uh these blocks you can do some funky stuff around mev and maximize your your um your uh i guess like profits from that and so that could have uh um risks for a twop oracles because you could potentially manipulate them if you were able to control various transactions within blocks if you knew that you were going to be a proposer now there are obviously solutions for this coming down the pipeline like uh ssla which i've talked about before um a lot on the refill actually and i think i went through it last week a little bit before but i had a blog post about it uh but yeah unisop labs has put out their own blog post on this explaining all of this and more and then also the other thing is that they have a blog post on this explaining all of this and more and it's quite lengthy actually uh i i i managed to skim through it today i haven't read it just yet but i highly recommend giving it a read if you're interested in learning about this stuff i'll link it in the youtube description below all right a tweet from vitalik here that i wanted to talk a little bit about where he says my concern with vr is similar to some anti-crypto people's concerns about crypto a feeling that people are quote in love with the idea of it end quote in a way that far out paces the idea of crypto i do think important apps exist but vr for the sake of vr won't work now i want to say i i kind of like agree with vitalik here and disagree with him so i agree with him on the part of there is definitely a feeling within i think the crypto community in general that they're in love with the idea of crypto they're in love with what crypto can enable and what and and the benefits and positivity that crypto can bring to the world but the the fact of the matter is up the activity within crypto if not most of it has been speculative casino games ponzi's you know there hasn't like if you look at the amount of value generated uh it's basically come from from that those things and those things aren't necessarily bad but if you're in love with the idea of crypto like i am to be like a decentralization maximalist and to you know better people's lives and to enable more freedom for people and you look at those sorts of things especially during bull markets you kind of look at it and like what are we even doing sometimes right i'm sure you've all had this feeling during a bull market you look at it you look at all this stupidity like what are we even doing here right and i think vitalik's drawing a parallel here with with vr uh is that it's it's very similar to cryptos where people have this utopian vision of vr where we're all going to be living in uh this vr world that's uh that is perfect and everything's sorted out for us and we're having a lot of fun in it uh and everything's you know great whereas i don't think that's actually going to be the case personally um i don't think that vr is going to be like this utopia i actually think vr is just going to be like the internet is today except in a virtual world right the internet is a quote unquote virtual world but it's not one that we really interact with like we do with vr now i'm not saying that vr games uh are bad or anything like that i've played plenty of them before and i love them but i'm talking about very specifically the idea of a vr world like an mmo for example it's basically free for all basically the idea of ready player one if you've seen that movie or read the book right so that like if i look at the internet and just like transpile that to vr i feel like we're just going to like recreate the internet in vr and it's actually not going to be that fun for people because it's just going to be the same bullshit we have on the internet in vr and it's not going to be that utopia that people want it to be um and then things like questions of like you know who moderates the vr world like is it just a free for all can anyone just do anything they want in the vr world can they say whatever they want can they harass whoever they want you can imagine this like if you want to create the recreate the real world in vr but just like add things like uh like you know space travel and flying cars and all the stuff that we don't have in real life okay that's fine but what about the social side of it can i as a person in vr go up to someone and just constantly stalk them right and constantly harass them and annoy them with no moderation with no one stopping me from doing that uh is there going to be like a police department in uh you know in in the vr world is there going to be a um a lot of uh uh laws and and are they going to be representatives that uh run the world so to speak or is it all just going to be running code like i don't know what that's actually going to look like obviously there are companies like meta uh which is facebook taking big bets on on this vision but you know that's still going to be there's still going to be a lot of control there so i think it's just going to end up looking like the current internet in in the way it kind of works um but where i kind of disagree with metallic a little bit here is that the parallels they they make sense but not in the same not not not totally right i think that crypto it tends to attract a very specific set of people at least the people who stick around not just the people who come for bull markets but the people who are in it for that like idea of crypto i think those people are definitely on the on the most end anti-government or at least anti-big government um they're definitely obviously freedom maximalists they're definitely uh people who are you know really care about decentralization and care about things like credible neutrality whereas with vr i don't think there's a lot of people like that i think i don't think there's really any people like that i think with vr it's people just wanting to escape reality uh whereas people we in crypto want to make reality better by providing better tools to people but if you want this vr utopia where you're living in a virtual world and and you believe it's going to be awesome because you can escape reality well i don't think it's going to end up like that uh and and i think that video games in general have actually trended towards uh going away from that vision especially with things like pay to win and in-app purchases it's just making people feel like they're not escaping reality as they they used to be and i get that like i'm taking i'm painting the uh maybe the cynical view of things here but i think that if we're not careful that's how it's going to end up and i don't think a decentralized like a fully decentralized free-for-all vr world would actually work very well because after all the problems i just mentioned plus all the ones i haven't mentioned there has to be some kind of moderation and some kind of rules baked in now can those rules be fully baked in within code i don't believe so because there are certain things you can't just bake into code and then and then okay if it's decentralized there's code running it and people are running the code like okay well what what if you want to change something that is it does it go through a governance process like what we go through with ethereum and then what if people object to that you know how much power do people have to change things within the game does the game start bler oh sorry the vr world does the vr world start blurring with the real world in that you do stuff in vr you earn money and then you can use you know you earn money in the real world and vice versa there's all these questions all these things and you know i i would love to live in uh in in kind of like a virtual uh world where everything was was dandy and everything was fine but i don't think that's the way it's going to play out um but yeah anyway i i'm curious to hear your thoughts on it actually if you want to say it in the youtube comments on the um daily great discord channel because this is something that i've thought about quite a bit because as you guys know i've been a massive gamer uh up until pretty much i got into ethereum i was a pretty big gamer and i loved the escapism of it but these days a lot of gaming feels like a chore to be honest and from everything that i've seen of vr worlds uh as azs today and and just like the logical conclusion of them i don't think they're going to be the utopia people want them to be just like how crypto is not the utopia that we all are trying like we all uh think it's going to be or we're in love with the idea of it a lot of crypto is shit right a lot of crypto is just scams and ponzis and stuff that we don't want to see but that's what comes with uh i guess like the free-for-all territory of decentralization incredible neutrality you can't have the good without the bad and you know unfortunately the bad right now or at least in bull markets is more pronounced than the good but over a long enough time frame i think the good will outweigh the bad but again that's me being in love with the idea of crypto uh and that's not reality just yet but i i'm i i do think that it's going to be reality eventually but it's just not it today but anyway i'm going to end it on that note so thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give it a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the disco channel and i'll catch you all next week thanks everyone

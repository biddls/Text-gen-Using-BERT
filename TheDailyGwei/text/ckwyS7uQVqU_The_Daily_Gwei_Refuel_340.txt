 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the dailygue refuel where we cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host anthony sassano and today's the 25th of march 2022  Alright everyone, let's get into it. after a few days of no refuel actually just only a couple of days, right? And I know today's episode is coming at you a bit later than usual. I'm actually recording it a bit later It's a quarter past 12 right now for me. Am uh, I usually put them out at 12 30 am But this will probably won't go out until uh till later there But uh, yeah, so where have I been the last couple of days? Well as you guys know was that blockchain, Australia I did this day in sydney on Tuesday and the day in Melbourne on Wednesday in Sydney. I had a panel with um With medhi from sigma prime that went really really well I had a lot of people coming up to me saying it was their favorite panel of the day They learned a lot and a medhi and I obviously talked a lot about kind of like eth2 consensus layer merge stuff And we bounced really well off of each other which was which was awesome I mean, we both super passionate obviously about ethereum and especially all the kind of like ethereum core development going on and things like that So that was a really great chat I'm, not sure where to find the recordings yet of all these sorts of things I'm sure they'll be on youtube eventually But if if you guys were able to kind of catch the live stream more actually at the event Uh, you would have you would have kind of like seen Seen that talk, but hopefully when I find the links to it I'll be able to kind of like link it to you and on the second day on the wednesday I closed out the day with kain from synthetics. We talked d phy we talked kind of like, uh, uh Kind of like layer twos talk alternative layer ones all that sort of stuff there as well Which is a very very fun conversation, uh that we had there too. So yeah, the the days themselves were really fun I mean, I met a lot of people. I met a lot of new people that didn't even know who They didn't know who I was as well which is which is cool because I think and people came up to me after my talk on the Tuesday and they really wanted to kind of like, um, You know know who I was know what I was doing, you know I know how they could get my my help on things like especially in the education space, which is really exciting Uh, and and this wasn't like a typical crypto conference There are a lot of people there who are very new to crypto A lot of people from government from regular, uh, like a lot of lawyers from you know A lot of people from the regulatory side and it was interesting getting their perspectives on the different things going on You know from kind of you know in crypto and them kind of like wanting to learn more about it So they can kind of go back to Other people and kind of educate them and as I said, I got approached from for by A fair few people who wanted my help with educating so i'm going to see where those kind of leads uh lead me essentially, but yeah, I mean it's funny because when I was giving the I guess like panel with uh with meti around eth2 and stuff like that. Uh, I think you know as i've as i've always said to you guys I think most of this industry is perpetually behind by at least like a year on what's happening within the ethereum ecosystem And that goes for absolutely everything and and and it goes for at most the core protocol stuff, right? Because A lot of it is very technical. A lot of it is very esoteric You don't really care to know about it if it doesn't have a direct impact on its value, right? And even when it does have a direct impact on its value A lot of people still don't know about it. Obviously the merge has a massive impact and a lot of people don't know that so I think for me What really opened my eyes is people were really interested in the technical stuff But they needed to explain to them in in to them in such a way Where it's kind of from a high level because I think a lot of the technical explanations tend to go very deep very quickly and they lose people and I think also the The delivery of the education is really important like for me I try to give the delivery on the refill as passionate as I can so that you guys can like You know feel the passion I have for this sort of stuff and kind of like keep you guys engaged with this But I know sometimes, you know, some of the stuff I talk about can be can be a little boring But I think when you're trying to read about this stuff when you're listening to a lot of other people Talk talk about this it can be way less engaging. So I think that's what i've always prided myself on The fact that I can give like education in a really passionate way and that actually came across It seems for a lot of people as well. So I mean all in all I had a ton of fun at this event Like the last couple days i'm very much looking forward to amsterdam now. I think as I said, this was like a I guess let's have a kind of it wasn't really an eighth conference It was a crypto conference, but also there's a lot of new new people there I'm, looking forward to getting to going to amsterdam because it's obviously going to be a lot of ethereum people there And it's going to be really cool. I'm getting a few different talks there and things like that as well So that's going to be very exciting too So hopefully, uh, some of you were able to make it to the event and then I saw you there I met a lot of people so I don't remember everyone I met And if you didn't make it hopefully you're able to kind of like watch the streams as well Everything was kind of like live stream And if I find the links to the videos if anyone else has them Please share them in the discord. I know there's a lot of people kind of looking for them right right now All right on to all the updates from the last few days that i've missed for you guys. So danny ryan Put out the latest edition of the finalized blog post series is number 34 Going over I guess the kiln testnet and basically, you know Everything that's happening on the merge side. So I mean I summarized for this for you guys last week There were obviously a couple of bugs in the kiln testnet the biggest one being the prism bug Client which caused prism to kind of like stop producing or start to produce invalid blocks and things like that Uh now because of that there is a lot of um Testing that needs to happen right? There's a ton of testing that still needs to happen uh, and as I mentioned on the last refill which I've seen a few people kind of like talk about this But I don't think I I said I didn't think that the june merge kind of like would still happen. I think maybe you know July still on on the table, but june was kind of like off the table I still think that but there are certain other people saying that they could still see a june merge We'll have to see as i've said to you guys before it was just a target window I'm, just giving my personal opinion based on kind of like the information that i'm seeing and if it happens in june still then good I i'm glad to be wrong. Like i'm not trying to be right about this sort of stuff I'm, just trying to you know, get you guys the most direct up-to-date information that I can But as i've said before I still think it's more likely to be july than june Um, and just because of the fact that the kiln testnet didn't go, you know as flawless as possible Even though it went really really well It didn't go as flawless as possible and this is a lot of testing that needs to be done So I wouldn't be surprised to see it in july or even I mean even august sort of thing And as I said last time I don't think these Things are delays because there never was a kind of like date given But I also think that no one's going to really care if it comes two to three months later than the projected kind of like Date here. I really think that people underestimate like how much you know crypto moves fast But at the same time there are periods where crypto moves really slow Um, you know in sort of in certain areas and I don't think it's going to matter too much at the end of the day So I guess go read this blog process. It's very very short It's got links to a bunch of other kind of like things as well to read but definitely go read it It'll be in the youtube description Um and on the merge as well terence from the prylabs team Uh has kind of like shared a screenshot of uh, what happens when proof of stake gets activated on the prism client So you can see or the prison validated client you can see here that there are a couple of pandas, uh kind of like Uh made an ascii code here and proof of stake activated on this on the screenshot here and I think the different validator clients will have different ways of displaying this information which i'm really looking forward to each of them and seeing what they do Because yeah, I mean this is only going to happen once right and this is a very very big deal And i'm very much looking forward to seeing my validator is kind of like spit these this ascii out, you know, depending on what what they what they kind of do with it here So very much looking forward to seeing that go forward there Uh next up we had an eof ecosystem support program allocation update for q3 and q4 2021 This was a reminder about this. Uh, I think I covered it on the refill when this came out on february 15th Uh last month there, but the reason why I wanted to talk about this is because it's topical, right? There's been a lot a lot of talk I guess over the last few days, especially about Funding of things and core dev funding and all that sort of stuff Now what I wanted to talk about here is the ethereum foundation specifically There was a bunch of discussions that we're having in the discord channel today about What the ethereum foundation's burn rate is like how much money are they spending each year out of their treasury? And there was a kind of like tweet that was brought up I think from 2019 or or a comment from 2019 where? Um, someone gave the ballpark figure. I think it was vatali that the ef in 2019 was going to spend 25 million dollars Or or something like that right or 30 million dollars in that. Yeah, i'm coming with the exact figures Now if they were spending that much in 2019 Which was obviously the depths of the bear market there was a lot less going on in core developer land Then how much would they be spending in 2022? I projected that they would be spending anywhere from 50 to 100 million in 2022 Now the ef treasury at least the public version of public. Um, uh, Uh, uh treasury that we can see is about a billion dollars worth of eeth So let's just say and I actually think it's more accurate to say that the ef is spending about a hundred million dollars in 2022 Given the fact that they have a lot of grants programs going like the ef ecosystem grants program They have a lot of um other initiatives that they're doing like the client incentive program. They have a lot of people on their payroll So let's say the ef has a 100 million dollar run rate for just this year now They're they have they have they have fiat reserves obviously from cashing out eeth But the e that they have left in their public treasury is worth about a billion dollars Now let's say they keep ramping that up and they spend 150 million next year and 200 million the next year, right? It's gonna it's probably gonna keep ramping up That doesn't leave them with that much money like the treasury may seem large because you you know, you see it there Okay, a billion dollars is a lot of money But then when you kind of like map out the run rate of the ethereum foundation you kind of see that Okay, well to manage that treasury well and to make sure it lasts especially with all the stuff happening in the you know And all the stuff that needs to be paid for in the ethereum ecosystem It can kind of run out relatively quickly now then you dive deeper into that you say, okay Well, what's this money being spent on individually is enough money going to core developers all this sort of stuff There's been a lot of discussions around this about this recently and as I said in the discord channel I I think it's kind of common knowledge that the ethereum foundation doesn't pay market rate Uh and and kind of like won't probably ever pay a market rate for people Um, like core developers or otherwise and they could probably make more money working Uh in somewhere else in the ecosystem, but as I said in the discord channel, I think for a lot of these people like money is important but The reason they stay at the ethereum foundation instead of just going somewhere else is because the work that they're doing To them at least feels much more impactful much more important to them than work that they could be doing elsewhere And I think for people who don't uh have a passion and don't kind of like really care about the work They do they they struggle to understand this because a lot of people at the end of the day Like out, you know inside and outside of crypto. They're just going to work a job for the money and that's totally fine Like there's nothing wrong with that. But unless you actually work Uh for more than money you won't understand why people would take a pay cut or take like less money than they could get Otherwise, you know elsewhere to work on more impactful stuff. I did this when I joined a um a crypto job in 2019 At set protocol. I took a pay cut from my previous job That's because my previous job I kind of like hated I wasn't doing the work that I wanted to be doing at all It wasn't a crypto job or anything like that. And then I joined set and it was amazing Like I would have worked for even less than what I was on because it was just so good I didn't even care about the money at that point and that was a point where I wasn't I didn't have a large crypto portfolio. This was 2019 guys Like I definitely did not have a large crypto portfolio But for me personally, I was very very happy at that point Like I was I was just as happy as I am now to be honest, right? Um, and that's because I was doing the work that I felt had a lot of impact. I was very interested in the work It was very exciting for me. Now I stayed there for about 18 months And then I kind of like left because I'm like I want to focus on doing More stuff with the daily way. I want to focus on doing more kind of like angel investing helping teams out in the early stages Doing advising all that sort of stuff and I you know, I still do that to this day, right? It's been over a year since I kind of like left set and I um I'm still doing this to this day because that's what I find to be the most impactful Work that I can do and I do all the other great stuff for free because I am able to do that But also because like I just love doing the review. I love doing the newsletter I love kind of talking in the disco channel with you guys Um, and I think that translates to a lot of people like a lot of the core developers in ethereum They love what they do. They feel like they're making so much impact like how often In technology in in the world in your life Are you going to be be able to work directly on something as impactful as the ethereum core protocol? You're not not very often right and I think a lot of these people are just concerned with making Just concerned with making sure that they can cover their bills and and they're kind of like getting paid You know what they consider to be a fair compensation even if it's not market rate and they're fine with that They're just going to do all their work and and they're fun. They're having fun with that And that's totally on them like no one's forcing them to work for less pay Like i'm telling you right now guys every single ethereum core developer could easily get a job anywhere else They wanted in this ecosystem and probably for more pay, but there's a reason that they're not doing that Obviously, there's more than just like them working on impactful stuff They have a loyalty to to ethereum and that that plays into it of course and stuff like that But you know, there's there's a reason there and I know you know Peter's been very loud from the geth team recently and he recently and kind of like people are thinking that he might jump ship over to To avalanche maybe he will right but I think in peter's case as I said last time it's it You know that money's one one side of it But it's also the side of like burnout right like a lot of these people have been working on this stuff for a very long Time and they just want to change they just burnt out and that's totally fine, too Like we shouldn't expect someone to stay in the same role for bloody, you know, 20 years of their life Like there's a lot of people who just especially the ones who who are passionate about their work and want to do impactful work Uh, they just get burnt out and they want to change and that's totally totally fine as well So I guess that's kind of like my perspective on this whole kind of like funding debate and things like that I really do think people need to see the other side of this and see that at the end of the day, you know Maybe you uh want to just do stuff for money Maybe money is everything to you at this stage in your life and that's totally fine But for a lot of other people there are things that matter to them way more than money and money is really just a tool And if they they've got enough money coming in that they can pay their bills They can live their life in in kind of like comfort wherever they are Uh, they're happy doing that not everyone wants to buy a lambo not everyone wants to buy luxury You know items not everyone wants to live in a fancy house A lot of people just want to be able to live comfortably and by live comfortably I mean pay their bills without worrying about them, uh and kind of like be able to kind of afford some luxuries here and there Of course, obviously, but you know, most people don't want to don't and help their families too, right? But most people don't want to to kind of like go and buy lambos and luxury items and stuff like that They they would rather do much more impactful work than that there. So so yeah Anyway, i'm going to move on from that, uh to the next update which came uh, chloe white here who actually met at um blockchain australia in in real life, um She shared a something today about anz the australian new zealand kind of like bank in australia here One of the top four banks has issued the first australia dollar stablecoin called the a dollar dc Which is a weird ticker for a stablecoin. I thought initially it was a play on acdc Which is obviously a very popular rock band, uh that came out of australia, but i'm not sure it might be that but yeah It's called a dollar dc and here chloe lists. Like how did anz do it? Well, they have a counterparty with uh, zero cap, uh with which australia's only full service crypto platform They have custody via fire blocks. They have audit. They did an audit with open zeppelin They're doing aml with chain analysis and they used the ethereum blockchain. That's why i'm talking about it, right? This is pretty cool. I mean Obviously, we're all about going bankless and trying to disrupt banks and all that sort of stuff. I'll be honest guys I don't think banks are really going anywhere. Uh, I think banks will adapt pretty quickly to a crypto world I've always said that I think that the real innovation of defi and of crypto is that it gives users a choice We no longer have to use a bank right to do these sorts of things. We can do it on our own But the banks are still going to be there people are going to want to use banks There's plenty of people who don't want to manage their own finances and they shouldn't have to if they don't want to And there's always going to be services available for them whether they be banks or other kind of financial services So that's why it's really cool to see that You know there's a bank here like anz getting involved with this and as i've said before like Other banks like com bank or commonwealth bank in australia have been very progressive with crypto They announced that they were going to enable crypto trading on their platform That was supposed to happen in q1 this year I mean we're all we're at the tail end of q1 now and I haven't heard anything about that obviously banks move slower than Than anything so that's still probably coming. Uh, but I don't you know, I don't think it's going to um, It's going to be uh to to be in q1 but I also heard a stat that I think nine hundred thousand of um of uh of uh, the commonwealth banks kind of like customers had sent money from their bank accounts to a crypto exchange and Just to contextualize it here guys. Australia's population is only 25 million and uh only the people over 18 Are really like have a bank account, right? So you can discount like all the all the children all the babies all that sort of stuff and and a lot of teenagers And just count the adult population and this was just commonwealth bank As I said, there's four major banks in australia and there's a bunch of other banks as well So that's not 900 000 that's a lot of people when you when you kind of like contextualize it like that So I think that that stuff's coming and I think you know anz doing these kind of like stable coins and australian dollar stable coins As well is really cool Uh, it just shows that they're really looking at this sort of stuff and they're dabbling in it. So so cool to see that from from anz All right, so element finance announced uh the first step toward decentralization by opening up applications for delegates and members of the governance steering Council, so there's a thread here about this and there's also a blog post very cool to see this I mean this does mean that uh, I I mean I I assume this means the token is coming, uh disclosure I'm an angel investor in element finance, but I haven't heard anything about a token or anything like that But to actually decentralize and to have like a delegate governance system and all that sort of stuff you need it you need a token Right. I mean, it's pretty obvious. So, uh, just some I guess like some uh, some alpha to pay attention to maybe there's going to be An airdrop. I'm not sure as I said, like I am an angel investor But I have no access to information about this sort of stuff. Like I don't know what's happening there I'm just assuming that since they're trying to decentralize there is going to be a token but I think It's really cool when I see Something trying to create like a dow for itself But also doing something different to the traditional dows like there's actually a lot of discussions at the blockchain week about dows and I talked to a lot of people about how I think that Dows have a massive issue in that a lot of them try to be like super decentralized from day one and they have like a leadership void That usually gets filled by the wrong people Some of them are really just multi-sigs, you know decentralization theater Some of them don't put any effort into actually decentralizing and it ends up just being a complete mess and the project fails because of that But I think element finance has actually put a lot of effort and a lot of work into this they're doing it the right way They're doing it relatively slowly. They're doing it in a way that's not going to be a good idea They're doing it relatively slowly. They're not just trying to go way into it you know, they haven't even issued or announced the token yet, but they're already doing kind of like A delegate call for delegates and members of the of kind of like the governance steering council, which is the gsc here So so yeah, I mean, I highly recommend giving this blog post to read to learn more about this But I thought this is really cool And they're kind of like one of the better I guess structures that i've seen in the dao space recently All right. So pseudotheos is back with another banger thread Uh, this is all about zk evms and why it is a massive breakthrough for ethereum scouting now If you're not following pseudotheos, uh, be sure to do so This is an up and coming, uh kind of like person that i've spoken about a lot recently on the refuel Uh, you know, I I kind of like always look for these kind of like, um people I know polly now was one obviously pseudotheos is another and I love seeing them because they just put together such amazing information In really digestible formats and this is just another kind of like one and this thread isn't actually very long here Uh, this is actually just a few tweets. So definitely give this a read I just wanted to highlight it for you guys. It'll be linked in the youtube description for you to do so Uh, but yeah pseudotheos is a banger follow. So definitely go give give them a follow there All right. So jerry sun here who's uh works in research at masari put together a thread on polygon So he starts off the thread by saying many know polygon for its sidechain or the pos chain as I like to call it Cheap gas fees fast transaction through port all the good stuff But beyond that sidechain the company's building a suite of layer two and infrastructure products as well And you'll be and you'll 100 be hearing more about it over the coming months Um, then he goes on to explain why over 12 tweet threads here now, obviously you guys know i'm an advisor to polygon So I talk about them a lot on the refuel, but they're doing a lot of great work I mean masari has a whole thing here And and they have an image here You can see polygons kind of like product stack and all the products that they're building So much going on like just on the l2 side alone is just just plenty going on here Um, you know plug on hermase might and nightfall and zero Uh so much going on and then you can kind of like scroll down and kind of Explains all this explains each of these solutions But what he also goes on about is what talks about is kind of like the the matic token as well in the in the report Here you can see on masari uh I don't want to talk about the token too much because obviously I have a lot of conflict of interest here being an advisor obviously Hold matic tokens just super disclosure there but in this report They talk about the matic token, which doesn't get talked about that much and I highly recommend giving it a read because it's actually pretty interesting About how the matic token will be, you know We'll go beyond the pos chain and what it's actually going to evolve into revamping the tokenomics all that sort of stuff there But I won't talk about too much about that because of my conflicts of interest there I want you to go read this blog post if you want to get that alpha and read this thread from jerry sun Of course, this will be linked in the youtube description below for you to do so All right, so optimism has a blog post out today called ether's phoenix, which is taking a step back from the optimizations And protocol minitae to uh remuninate on ruminate on coordination public goods funding and where optimism fits in now you guys will know or some of you will know that About optimism is retroactive public goods funding initiative where they basically give All of the profits from their centralized sequencer to public goods in a retroactive way And they're talking about kind of like summoning, you know, the ether's phoenix here the angel who reward you for summoning it A kind of reverse rock goes basilix and I mean this is all about you know I was talking about funding before but all about doing public goods funding in a more Efficient and effective way. I highly recommend reading this blog post. It's pretty short here But uh, I the reason I wanted to bring it up is because i've been talking a lot about funding recently and about how we need Put more public goods funding there's obviously the protocol guild which all of you should have donated to On uh on gitcoin grants. I think gitcoin grants matching around is pretty much ended now by the time you you will have watched this but There's so much going on in the funding space right now guys and Just a refresher on what the protocol guild is They're trying to get projects to kind of like donate to this kind of Protocol guild like a portion of their treasury in order to kind of like give back to uh, the core developers And other kind of like interested parties in that time in that arena there And uh, they're aiming to raise a lot of money. They're trying to get this protocol guild to like, you know, seven eight nine figures Potentially ten figures, uh, uh one day right and kind of give a portion of that Sorry trying to kind of give all of that to public goods and then you have optimism doing this with the retroactive public goods funding There's just a lot going on and I recommend getting this blog post for more context around that as well All right, so there's been a bit of confusion around this All right, so there's been a bit of confusion lately about game stop and what they're doing in the nft space They've obviously announced partnerships with two l2s immutable x and loop ring here But immutable x put out a thread today about how Their partnership is going to go with with game stop basically building a marketplace all that sort of stuff And they also mentioned like how loop ring is working with game stop as well But it's not kind of I guess say um A zero something here game. So I was working with both of these solutions There's going to be things happening on both of them. Uh, and I think that's why mutable has put out this thread because They seem that there was a bit of confusion around this I think uh, so yeah Definitely give this thread a read if you were confused about You know why? Why gamestop is working with both immutable and loop ring? There are reasons for both and there are things being done on both ends there as well All right So arbitrum shared a tweet a few a couple of days ago about the arbitrum Seq that being a top spender on ethereum over the past 24 hours you can see here that they uh spent uh in the last 24 hours Uh at time of this screenshot was 64 000 or 21.6 Eth here, which is I think 0.6 percent of the um, the total ethereum network now as I said to you guys before Layer twos are eventually going to take over Pretty much all of the ethereum layer one block space probably won't happen for a little while still But we're going to replace all of ethereum l1 kind of like transactions with just l2 proofs and um And call data which will take up all the block space and and basically be responsible for All the fee revenue being generated on ethereum l1 So I just wanted to kind of highlight this this tweet here because i've been talking about this a lot on there on the refuel Over the past god. It's been a while now You know, it's been probably a year at this point where i've been talking about this kind of like phenomenon that's going to happen But to see it kind of like happening It's in in such a big way and to see kind of like the arbitrum sequencer and other l2 sequences paying L1 and actually doing what we said it was going to do is really really cool So so kind of just wanted to highlight that for you guys there All right, uh speaking of uh optimism and their optimizations that are coming to their network Their call data compression is actually going live on mainnet this thursday guys, which is today Uh, yeah, it is. It's it's thursday today, right? So if this is going live today may or may not be live uh by the time you watch this video, but this means that uh Fees on optimism are coming down, uh, pretty pretty quickly. I think uh, Sorry, pretty significantly because of the core data compression. I remember they got about 40 percent less 40 reduction in fees here So that's actually huge. I think I don't know what the fees are right now if I bring up l2 fees Right now and I check like the optimism swap fee is at 51 cents So if they're gonna let's let's say they actually do reduce it by 40 percent Right, that's uh, that's coming down to 30 cents guys So we're going from 51 cents to 30 cents just from from this optimization alone for a for a swap And it's going to even keep coming down even further than that Due to more optimizations coming and also uh, the the future eips that are coming as well. So Like later two transactions are just so cheap right and this is a gray is at 40 right now So when gray was at 20, it would have been even cheaper than that. Oh god It's just it's amazing to see like how quickly the l2s are getting cheaper and cheaper and the l1s are actually the alternative L1s are actually getting more expensive the cheap ones that have been kind of like talking about how they like super cheap They have super cheap fees. They're actually getting more expensive because of the fact that they don't have what the l2s have Which is the magic of basically being much more scalable being able to kind of like do all these optimizations Without kind of like sacrificing security of decentralization because they inherit all that from ethereum layer one Really is just the beauty of l2s coming coming to fruition here I'm super excited to see this continuing to evolve and continuing to see more optimizations come to the network here All right, finally here we have git pop-up which is a An announcement here from them saying that they're going to be launching on april 7th So open source contributors get ready to claim some of your pops here You can go to to check out this blog post with and kind of like this. Sorry explains what git pop is here So the one liner is git pop exists to memory Memorialized software contributors as contributions as pops we're beginning by building a platform for minting powers based on github activity Our inspiration for building git pop comes from wanting to solve challenges of recognition reputation building that we've experienced firsthand as open source developers and maintainers So go and I guess like read this blog post for more information about this I think this is a really really cool kind of like project. I love anything got to do with pop to be honest Like it's such an awesome project.

 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the deadly way refuel where we cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host the and this is ano and today's the first of august 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So it was ethereum's seventh birthday over the weekend So ethereum was I guess born or the ethereum mainnet went live july 30th, 2015 So it was obviously july 30th over the weekend and it turned seven, you know It's kind of funny when you think about the fact that ethereum is only seven and it's as big as it is, right? If you like a lot of people like to compare ethereum and crypto and blockchains more generally to I guess the evolution of the internet well, the first iterations of the internet came out in like the 40s or 50s I mean it depends how far you want to go back if we go back to ARPANET I believe like if I quickly google that because I don't want to get this wrong I think ARPANET was established here in 1969, right? And then we didn't really get I guess Consumers really using the internet till the 90s So it was quite a while like it was probably a good 20 something years until consumers were really You know using the internet and getting value out of it, but then probably even more than that 30 30 well 1969 to 70 to 2000 is 30 years and then 35 40 years until Kind of it really went exponential you could say, you know after the kind of like dot com crash and everything like that But that I think you know was due to the fact that the internet needed a major infrastructure rollout to actually happen and you know The hardware needed to kind of like get better and better over time for the experiences to become seamless for people and all that sort Of stuff there, right? Like you need to build internet towers and everything like that And lay the cable of course as well. Whereas with crypto, I mean it's been around since bitcoin came out in 2000 I guess like eight slash nine, right? So you could say around uh, 14 years at this point, right? Uh, so it's it's it I mean if you take bitcoin it's been like a little while But it hasn't actually been that long and there are plenty of people who are using it I mean there are more people using kind of like crypto today and using I would probably So that's the thing when you think about like people using crypto It's kind of more about okay Are they buying just coins on exchanges or are they actually on chain? I think on chain is very very low to compare to people that's buying coins on exchanges But there is obviously like a kind of double-edged sword there. I do count people buying on exchanges Well, then you kind of say oh well crypto has massive adoption um But then that doesn't really because you look at on chain and there's hardly kind of like anyone I mean You could say there's probably like five maybe ten percent of people that buy on exchanges actually do stuff on chain So there's all that to consider but you know If you just kind of like consider the fact that the industry is still so incredibly young Yet it's achieved so much already and it has such a large market cap Like even after the the massive um downturn that we've seen the whole industry is still worth a trillion dollars, right? Like over a trillion dollars ethereum is still a 200 plus billion dollar network alone in just seven years Which is crazy to me. I I absolutely think it's crazy I think it's what's even crazier. Is that ethereum is like a totally new thing, right? It's not like some Some kind of like, uh app that people can just download on their phone and away they go with it or anything like that It's a totally new thing that requires like different kind of levels of thinking. It's definitely nowhere near finished I mean Vitalik said in his ecc talk that he considers ethereum to be about 40 I think finished Which obviously that means we're not even halfway over finished yet And yet we have so much kind of like adoption such a large community and so many people kind of involved with that Which I think is really really cool, but still like a lot of obviously growth potential to go So yeah, let I mean seven years. What's ethereum going to be like in seven years from now? I don't know like I feel like ethereum seven years from now If we hit all the roadmap items that we want to we pretty much be at the kind of like splurge Which is the last part of the the roadmap, which is the nice to haves essentially We pretty much be there I think we would have done all the other phases or all the other things would have been implemented already In seven years time now, hopefully i'm not jinxing it. Hopefully it doesn't take longer than that But yeah Just thinking about the kind of like craziness that has gone and where ethereum has come from where it is today And where it's going is is really exciting. So I do think that you know, if you take like that 40 kind of finished kind of uh, I guess, uh, Uh statistic there then you kind of like apply it out We do another 40 in seven years Maybe another 50 in seven years and we get to like 90 complete and that 10 is the last Uh kind of like nice to have of ethereum Well, then it's you know, it's probably kind of like makes a lot of sense there So so yeah Anyway, I obviously have a lot to kind of like thank ethereum for thank the community for uh, I kind of like always do that Whenever it's ethereum's birthday. I just kind of like do a bit of reflection and be like wow No ethereum really did change my life and I hope it changed your lives and I hope it is changing your life It's just so amazing that there's it's a technology at the end of the day, right? It is not a living thing But it feels like it's a living thing sometimes because of the people that make up that technology and it feels like we're part of Like a living breathing kind of organism that is ethereum even though it's a it's kind of like a physical network Grounded in kind of like machines. It still has a lot of human elements to it as i've discussed obviously at length before in the refill So yeah, I just wanted to kind of like talk a little bit about the ethereum's birthday there Uh, well, I guess like one year till its next birthday from here, right? All right. So speaking of ethereum upgrades the girly merge is fast approaching. I mean today is the fit of the first of august So between the sixth and twelfth is when we're expecting the girly merge But you can now track the progress of it by hitting heading to the bordell.wtf website now Those of you that have been tracking the other testnet mergers will be familiar with this website. Nothing new here You've got the ttd in the top left. You did have the hash rate below this but girly isn't a proof of work network It's a poa network. It's a proof of authority. Um, so it works differently. There's no kind of like hash but it It kind of like um, it can produce blocks. Uh, or kind of like it has a It has a concept of difficulty based on I think the validators that are part of the poa network and if something If some of them kind of like fall off well then uh, you know The difficulty changes something like that not totally across the details there, but there is a similar element so that's why you only see the ttd here and not any kind of like, um, Any hash rate below it but according to this site right now? We should be expecting the merge to happen around august 11th at 11 p.m I think that would be in utc time 11 p.m. UTC I think or closer to 12 a.m. UTC there So yeah, it's probably gonna happen. Like I don't know why they said 6 to 12th of august Maybe they'll just given like the widest band as possible, but I would expect you know between 10th and 12th Really? I don't I don't really expect it to happen earlier than that. I mean, I hope it doesn't happen earlier than that because I might not be able to make the the live stream It's actually my anniversary with my fiance on the 8th of august. So let's let's make sure it happens on like the 11th Not the 8th guys for my for my sake I want that poll up for being on the call But but yeah, you can kind of like go to this website yourself to keep track of everything happening here Maybe it'll happen sooner. Maybe it'll happen later. We'll see how that evolves but we're very very close only about 10 days away I guess you could say 10-ish days and then it's mainnet guys like Yeah, so close that we could have an ethereum merge mainnet in six to seven weeks from now if it happens in mid to late September which I still think is a pretty good Pretty good kind of chance haven't seen any chatter about delaying that date or anything like that I think once we'd see girly go through and if it goes through well if everything goes like it did for Robston and sepolia I Don't think there's going to be any kind of like pushback or anything from any of the developers or researchers It's basically gonna be like okay It's go time let's schedule this let's give a ttd let's target mid to late september or that week of september 19th as they kind Of like said on on the call a few weeks ago and let's get this thing done so close guys I can't wait But yeah, definitely check out this site if you want to keep a close eye on the girly merge timing All right, so i've been talking about eip 48 44 a lot lately over the weekend I put out a few tweets about this basically saying that Post merge i'm going to shift my channel to the next one Post merge i'm going to shift my shilling from shilling the merge to shilling eip 48 44 and a refresher I mean i've talked about this a lot, but the refresher for you guys is that 48 44 is proto dank sharding It is an eip that you know I think if eip 1559 was the biggest and most anticipated eip in ethereum's history I think 48 44 should be just as big if not bigger than it because of the fact that 1559 was awesome. It is awesome. It did a lot of good for the network Obviously, we're burning eith. We're kind of like stop. We stopped leaking that value to To to everyone we actually kind of like bring a lot of that value back in in house and flows to eith but on top of that we also Uh kind of like smoothened out the fee market made uh kind of like priority inclusion a lot better and you know A bunch of different kind of like things that are definitely paying dividends for for users Whereas 48 44 I think is going to have a much bigger impact for end users than then 1559 did even though 1559 Uh smoothened out the fee market 48 44 as i've mentioned before makes roll-ups incredibly cheap like Subcent transaction fees and it actually shifts the burden of scale From the ethereum layer one to the roll-ups themselves. And then what do I mean by that? Basically, what I mean is that you saw what happened with arbitrum They got uh congested because they have that artificial limit in place during the odyssey events and the transaction fee spiked Now the both ultimism and arbitrum today are not at capacity But their transaction fees are still not subcent right like if I go to l2 fees.info right now Both optimism and arbitrum cost around 20 25 cents Uh to send eith and about 30 to 40 cents to swap tokens at around a 10 gwei gas price and that is mostly if not, you know all layer one gas costs because of the fact that L2 settlement to layer one is still too expensive now with eip 48 44 It introduces a new transaction type on layer one called blob carrying transaction type And this is purely part of the consensus layer and that basically gives roll-ups This can only be used by by roll-ups basically and and layer twos It basically gives them space to store all this data And that's taking up the space on layer one ethereum and then it expires after a month Uh, it's still kind of like part of the chain But it the kind of like details so to speak expire and then if you're one of those details You can download them install them yourselves and everything like that. You can verify the correctness of them because All the hashes and stuff are still on chain um, but yeah, that's that's basically what it is, so Those costs would collapse down to you know at current demand levels down to subcent transaction fees Uh, but if demand starts spiking if the roll-ups themselves start hitting their own limits that they've got in place Well, then they'd you know, their fees are obviously going to go up again doesn't matter how cheap it is for them to post data On layer one ethereum they're still bound by their own constraints so that's why i've always said that that layer twos, uh kind of like Get the best and and the worst of layer one and layer two, right? Like they they've got the limitations and the pros of each thing there They get the security decentralization of ethereum layer one and kind of like get to outsource all that stuff to to l1 But they also inherit the l1 l1 lack of scalability as it exists today but to an extent not not, you know to the extent that l1 has its scalability issues, but Definitely it still exists whereas post dang sharding that kind of like goes away for a little while It'll obviously still not give us infinite scaling or anything like that But uh, it will give us a lot for a while and then what ends up happening is that that the burden shifts back to The roll-up so it's kind of like a balancing act where The l1 will scale then the roll-ups will have to scale to match the l1 scale and then you know that maybe that maybe those Roll-ups get filled up because they have so much scale and then they hit their limits. Okay Well, then they scale further and then l1 has to scale more and we have obviously plans on both layers To scale as much as we can but that's the balancing act that we're going to be playing with over the next few years And on top of that you also have a kind of like these upgrades coming which I I think I don't know if I have a tweet About these upgrades here. I think I do. Yeah, both arbitrum nitro and optimism bedrock Which are the two major upgrades coming to arbitrum and optimism respectively that are going to increase scalability of these systems now I don't know how much bedrock is going to increase the scalability of optimism I think for nitro and arbitrum it's about 10x what it is today So arbitrum will be able to handle 10x the demand it saw I guess like when it peaked during odyssey But then if it reaches that capacity well, it's going to kind of like revert back to what we already saw now Obviously nitro isn't the final upgrade. They're going to keep putting upgrades in they're going to keep doing more and more here And then with those l1 upgrades coming with protodunk sharding and things like that. That's also going to happen But as I said, it's a balancing act It's kind of like shifting to the different layers depending on where we are in in kind of like the um In the scaling ecosystem there and finally before I move on from this. I just wanted to highlight that protolambda There's one of the halves of protodunk sharding So for those of you don't know protodunk sharding the term is actually made up of two people whose names protolambda here on twitter Who has been an ethereum researcher for a long time he's currently at optimism Optimism labs working on optimism and still working on ethereum core stuff And dan cred feist who works at the ethereum foundation who came up with dank sharding Well, you know proto and dan crad came up with protodunk sharding which is basically a I guess you could say really early version of dank Sharding that still gives us a lot of benefits gives rollups a lot of benefits Well, he posted the slides here from his etc talk about 4844 So if you want just like a clean overview of it, you can go check that out But there's also the eip44 website which you should just google and you'll be able to check that out as well I suggest getting familiar with eip44 as familiar as you can Dedicate time to kind of like researching it going through the faq going through everything to make sure you understand then what benefits it brings Because you're going to be hearing a lot more about it not only from me But from everyone after the merge because that is the thing to look forward to after the merge like yeah We have beacon chain withdrawals coming and things like that, but no one's excited about beacon chain withdrawals. I mean, it's just a thing, right? It's just the thing we have to do because it's part of like, um, the whole kind of like staking ecosystem We have to have a way for people to kind of withdraw from staking right but no one's like Up in arms about a bit like oh my god. I'm so excited that withdrawals are coming unless they plan to sell Maybe they're excited. They're finally going to be able to sell their eith. I don't know but yeah, it's a different kind of excitement, right? whereas with the 4844 Every single person is going to be affected by this because of the fact that if you're using something on a layer two Your costs are most likely if not certainly depending if these roll-ups are congested at the time Which I don't think they will be but your costs of doing transactions is going to come down dramatically And and it's just super a super exciting thing coming to the network So and that is the most exciting near-term thing after the merge like obviously There are other upgrades coming obviously there are other upgrades coming in the longer term too But in terms of like ones that to kind of like be excited about post merge or immediately post merge would be uh, proto Dank sharding that's for sure All right, speaking of I guess like optimism uh bedrock smart contracts here or calvin ficta Put together a great thread about the optimism bedrock upgrade itself roll-up decentralization and zk And then he said something here where he goes bedrock is a roll-up client not an optimistic roll-up client so again hinting at the fact that Optimism has been working on zk stuff, you know arbitra stephen goldfeder from arbitrum did a similar thread last week Hinting out the arbitrum has been working on zk stuff as well And I think nitro is kind of like in the same vein as that the same as kind of bedrock Uh, but I thought that was funny because so many people for so long thought oh my god These optimistic roll-ups are so obsolete, you know because zk roll-ups are coming and I said for the longest time that When zk tech is ready, it's not ready today, but when it is ready the the uh, Optimistic roll-up teams are going to be there and going to adopt that technology. They're not going to be Like I guess what what's the term i'm looking for? They're not going to be stubborn about it They're not going to be like oh my god. No my technology is best We spent so long kind of building this up and then we're going to be like, oh my god My technology is best. We spent so long kind of building this stuff. We're not going to just abandon it We're going to stick with this No, that's that's not how the ethereum ecosystem works. Maybe it's how the bitcoin ecosystem works So they're so stubborn about changing anything, but that's never been the ethereum ecosystem That's never been the way uh, kind of like ethereum does things and I think that expands to layer twos as well. So That's why you're not going to see These optimistic roll-up teams go down with the ship so to speak if it turns out that All the benefits that it's promised to give us it gives us all that that kind of like extra scale better cryptographic Security and guarantees and everything like that Well, then we're just gonna they're just gonna use that and that's why they're building For those kind of like upgrades in the future by building stuff like bedrock and nitro So I thought this was a great thread kind of going through that more You should definitely give this thread a read but there's one other tweet that I wanted to highlight here from kelvin Uh, if I can find it in his thread, which one was it? Uh where he says, uh, you know, there's no reason why bedrock can't use a zk proof system instead We think optimistic roll-ups currently have massive advantages over their zk counterparts But bedrock has been designed to make a seamless transition between optimistic and zk possible That I can't even like say it any clearer than this guy's like this is very clear proof from someone who works at optimism right saying that bedrock has been designed with kind of like Kind of like future proof in mind and it's there's no reason why a seamless transition between optimistic roll-up Which is what optimism is today and kind of getting into a zk roll-up in the future can't happen Like it's going to happen if zk stuff gets to that point, which I think it will but we don't know when but it will Get to that point Which I think is just absolutely awesome Like I I love seeing this because the worst thing and the thing that i've always worried about when it comes to ethereum And I don't worry about as much these days, but I used to worry about it a lot more Maybe in 2018 2019 when the proof of stake kind of like I guess road map was in flux I used to worry a lot about ethereum getting stuck getting like ossified too early and not being able to do upgrades both that you know layer one and layer two Uh and layer two actually I was worried about that and probably until maybe early 2020 until I started seeing a lot more action here We did see 29 action in 2019 with um optimism coming to the scene and kind of like doing the uni pick demo and stuff Like that, but you know, I still kind of like was like, you know, what's going on here? Right. It was still a little bit in flux, but then it all came together And over the last couple years, I haven't really felt that I felt like ethereum is in the best place That's ever been in terms of kind of like pushing updates out even though they may take longer than we would like There's still stuff getting done, right? There's still like a lot of things being researched in parallel developed in parallel And the same is true for layer twos if not more so for layer twos because they can move faster than layer one, obviously So as I said, I used to be worried about it a lot especially during 2019 2019 And I don't think it was just price influencing my my concern back then because I didn't really care about price Um, but I was just concerned about the fact that 2017 had a lot of hype around Obviously people thought proof of stake was going to come that year There was some layer two scaling like right in with state channels and stuff like that and it was plasma Uh, but then it all kind of like fizzled away and we were in no man's land for a little bit in 18 and 19 And then I think in in kind of like 19 we started coming together with a little bit of stuff and then in 2020 We really came together with defi summer and defi just taking off and obviously the bull market coming back and Making kind of like defi such a a wild ecosystem But we also saw uh the beginnings of a really vibrant layer two ecosystem coming online that continued into 2021 And has basically reached the you know critical mass in 2022 We're just there's no signs of it slowing down at all And I would know this because i've been doing the daily way kind of like refuel since late 2020 and i've been doing the newsletter since mid-2020 Uh, so i've been covering this every single day so I think that i'm maybe one of the the kind of like best people and most interesting people in the ecosystem in terms of like being able to Notice shifts in in kind of like what's happening across the ecosystem because I just paid so much attention to it And people other people that that can kind of like pick up on this as well such as the guys from bankless They're very close to the metal. I've spoken to them about this too. Uh, and they basically agree with me It's just like it's crazy to think that we were so optimistic about ethereum in 2018 and 2019 and ethereum development When in reality looking back now There wasn't really that much to be optimistic about right like it was kind of some sort of blind kind of optimism to an extent But I don't think that's been the case since early 2020. I think since then we've really really taken off as an ecosystem And there's just no signs of slowing down. Anyway a little bit off kind of like a tangent there a little bit off topic But I think it does fit into what you said here, but i'll link us kelvins Um thread in the youtube description below for you to check out All right. So speaking of layer twos vitalik had an interesting tweet here where he quote tweeted Kelvin's tweet and said here's a hybrid idea optimistic plus zk governance only Adju-ju-ju-dicates bugs between the two man. I can't say that word people gonna make fun of me for that And then it continues by saying, you know number one publish block wait 24 hours for fraud challenges if no challenge publish publish Zk snark finalize if there is a challenge Decide based on two of three of a challenge game zk snark governance I've said before that the only reason optimistic roll-ups have a seven day kind of fraud dispute period is arbitrary It is not a strict rule of the system. I I actually think that in theory optimistic roll-ups could have a one block fraud kind of proof system But the problem is is that the whole point is that you want to be able to detect fraud? In kind of like in a way that gives enough enough people enough time to detect it like you obviously probably can't detect it In one block, but maybe you could do it in an hour. For example Maybe you could have a kind of like a challenge game run in an hour With the fraud proof system and and kind of like get that all sorted out there But Vitalik's idea here is to kind of like make a hybrid of that right get the optimistic kind of like challenge game Have governance and have zk stuff but only use two of three of them in case of a challenge, right? So you could use a challenge game and governance in or you can use challenge games zk snark Or you could use zk snark and governance and you know, it's so on and so forth, right? So I think That's a cool idea. I don't know if someone's going to do this in practice. I don't like from all the concern trolling around seven day withdrawal periods I don't think anyone's really cared that much because we have so many bridging protocols now and so many protocols that allow you to do fast exits and stuff like that But on top of that as as these later two ecosystems become more and more developed Right and more and more kind of more and more people go on there more and more liquidity kind of gets on there more and more Of an ecosystem gets built out I think people aren't going to care about withdrawing off of off of these things right? They're not going to care about offboarding onto layer one ethereum from layer two because like layer one ethereum probably isn't going to be a place where There is much for them to do and on top of that if they're going to go to fear well They can just go to a centralized exchange direct l2 to centralized exchange l2 and have their deposit Credited in the same amount of time. It will take a normal l1 deposit to be credited So I don't know if anyone's going to build this it is cool to think about but yeah for all the concern trolling around the The kind of like seven day withdrawal period I haven't personally seen anyone really complaining about it, but still a cool idea There's a bit of comments and discussion in The thread here from Vitalik i'll link in the youtube description for you to check out All right, so scroll's got another tweet thread slash blog post out today Kind of describing the architecture of scroll So they say in this post we take a deeper dive into scrolls overall architecture Which in its initial state is composed of a centralized sequencing node and decentralized proving network? So you can check out this blog post for full details on that and this thread here for basically a tldr But yeah, i'm loving these things from scroll like I I actually really love when teams kind of put out I guess bytes not I mean bite size is relative definition, but like they kind of like put out constant I guess like I guess what what am I saying here constant education around their own kind of like Architectures and other things around kind of like what they're building for people to kind of like digest as time goes on now As I said, this is this is relatively bite-sized I mean this shouldn't take you too long to read wouldn't even take you five minutes to read this maybe understanding it would take A bit longer, but basically I love these sorts of things because I love like obviously I love learning But I love learning about things on the bleeding edge as well and in such a simple way and such and as simple way as possible I think is a really great way to kind of like get people on board with your mission people to join your community Get people to be more involved and that's exactly what scroll has been doing with all of these educational posts that they've been putting out I guess over the last few months, so I look forward to them continuing to do this I'm super excited to keep reading them But i'll link this one in the youtube description for you to check out just wanted to put it on your radar in case you missed it All right. Finally here. We have an announcement from stateful works where they announced something called the new stateful works Which is an nft benefit sale for the ethereum core devs working on the merge This is being curated and organized by sw jpeg and sophia Garcia here, so I don't think this is the official merge nft. I think this is just another thing that's happening another nft That's kind of like happening as I said, it's called new home of the heart, which is a benefit nft sale But I think there's going to be a separate kind of like an official Merge nft kind of like what we had for efp1559, but that hasn't been announced yet from what i've seen But yeah, you can read the full details of what this is in this very very short blog process This is actually bite-sized blog post here if you want to know how to get involved with that and there's also a twitter thread for an Even shorter view here. But yeah, I just wanted to kind of like clarify that I don't think this is the official merge nft This is just another kind of initiative going on and the proceeds from this sale are going to call devs working directly on the merge Which is always a fun and and good thing there. So very very excited about that Definitely check it out if you haven't yet All right. I've got a few minutes left here today's kind of like end of episode topic I have something that I kind of like was thinking about over the weekend that I wanted to talk more about today But there is a funny kind of like phenomenon that i've noticed being in crypto like a fair few cycles now I mean my first crypto foray was in the early days of crypto I stuck around for a bit in 2014, but didn't really stick around in 2015 2016 But technically i've been a part of like three of these crypto market cycles now the 2013 cycle 2017 and 2020 slash 2021 cycle And the kind of thing that always strikes me about them is that it's always the same like you might think it's different You might think oh this time is different, but it is always the same I'm not just talking about the market action the market action obviously drives the cycle itself But in terms of kind of like we have like this massive influx of users come in right then Obviously they come with money the prices go up blah blah things get heated things get crazy There's all these new narratives flying around there's all these oh my god, you know, this time is different. Everything's gonna be amazing We're gonna get mass adoption any day now blah blah like all that sorts of stuff, right? And to an extent there's always like a new narrative that pops up too like in 2017 It was icos in 2013 ethereum wasn't around but there was kind of like a new narrative that popped up And it was like ethereum wasn't around but there was kind of like this bitcoin narrative that spawned after Silk Road was shut down that brought up a lot of a lot of attention on the bitcoin And then in 20 kind of 20 slash 2021. Well 2020 was defy 2020 and and I think bitcoin institutional adoption was a bit of a narrative or probably a lot of a narrative in 2020 as well Then 2021 we had like Nft stuff a lot of nft stuff going on Like the old tail one stuff as well going on. Um, and I think kind of like that ended us out for the year About November we kind of like peaked there, right? So it's kind of funny how we always have something different that doesn't really kind of like map to what we had before like There was not really any icos in 2020 slash 2021 right like there were token sales, but it wasn't the main thing It wasn't something that was capturing everyone's attention like it did in 2017 And there was really barely any talk of kind of like anything related to drug markets or anything related to silk road in 2017 for example, right Um, and then we had like nfts and defy this cycle So I wonder if in the next cycle is that still going to be a major theme? I think it will I don't know if we're ever going to get a like a full repeat of defy summer I don't think that's going to happen because Defy summer happened in like probably half of the reason why it happened the way it did was because it was so new for a lot of people and It was just kind of like a once-off kind of thing where captured a lot of people's attention But all the og's are pretty much like I guess bored of that sort of stuff in the sense that They've already experienced that a lot of times. It's kind of like oh, yeah, whatever It's it's kind of like liquidity incentives yield farming. We've done all that before who cares right? Nfts is a broad topic. I think nfts is going to be persistent But i'm thinking like is it are these things going to be the main focus of the next cycle? Like is there going to be something else driving this i'm curious to hear your thoughts on it as well guys, but I think that there will be but I I kind of like think that The defi and nft ecosystems are so strong and there's so much of a kind of like addressable market there And they're kind of like they can be sustainable That I think they're going to be part of us for many many cycles to come. I think they're going to Bring what bring us to kind of like mainstream adoption But is it going to be the main thing of the next cycle? I don't think so. I think we'll have something new Maybe I can't pick what it is But it might be layer twos like maybe everyone gets like super excited about layer twos instead of layer ones this time and that becomes A thing or maybe there's something else that I haven't even thought of maybe some for some reason someone figures out a way to do Dows in some way that gets people excited about it. I don't know right but from my experience has always been It's always a funny kind of phenomenon has how there's always been like this major theme and there hasn't really been overlap in those themes There's been similarities sort of but it's kind of like being a totally new thing Where everyone's always been like this time is different and that's what kind of like leads us to these Super speculative bubbles that have those blow off tops because it's just kind of like euphoria phase It's a new paradigm phase. So I'm curious what happens next cycle and what kind of like leads us there next cycle But yeah, I'm curious to hear your thoughts as well So definitely comment on YouTube if you've got any thoughts but also in the discord channel as well But I think that's gonna be it for today So thank everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give it a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the discord channel and i'll catch you all tomorrow.

 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily gray refuel wary capitalist news near theorem ecosystem I'm your host Anthony's Asano and today's the 19th of January 2022. All right, everyone. Let's get into it So this kind of governance proposal that had been posted to I guess are there to deploy other v3 to arbitrum one and optimism Have both a pass you can see here mark Zeller from our there Posted that governance has spoken of a v3 will be on arbitrum and optimism So, you know, I've been saying this for I guess like a few months now Really that I expected our v3 to come to both our bitumen optimism relatively soon But now that it's done and gone through governance. It means that it can actually kind of like be deployed there I'm not sure like how long until this happens I think it's gonna happen sooner rather than later given how much are there has been teasing v3 and their layer to roll out lately So I'm very very very excited for that. I think as I mentioned before a key missing piece to To optimism and arbitrum have been the kind of like missing piece of a money market, right? Or I mean they have money markets But like one of the popular money markets like are there one on ones that have like a lot of trust behind them You know the brand awareness all that good stuff there So very much looking forward to seeing our v3 go live and both of these networks Hopefully as a simultaneous launch that would be really cool to see because I think that you know I'll determine optimism as I've mentioned before they're two of the main optimistic roll-up networks. I know there's others out there There's kind of like the forks of optimism like metis and things like that I know that metis has more TVL than optimism right now because they have a token to incentivize that sort of stuff But in terms of like novel tech that's actually been developed by the teams themselves Optimism and arbitrum are kind of like, you know The two juggernauts here and they're basically are in a race to I guess kind of like get as much adoption as possible but at the end of the day, you know, I've kind of like been seeing this lately where I think the l2s Shouldn't be fighting amongst themselves at all It shouldn't be trying to steal market share from each other The pie is gonna get so much bigger with the amount of people that are gonna be on boarded through these l2s and other things Like that and that I think at this point They should just be focused on kind of like on boarding as many users as possible Rather than trying to like poach users from other kind of like l2s If anything we should be poaching users from the alternative l1s Because at the end of the day a lot of people are only using these old l1s because they've got cheaper fees Well now that we have cheaper fees with optimism and arbitrum you can come back and kind of like use these things But I think people will do for sure and I think a lot of newer people will do that as well But also speaking of cheap fees optimism announced today that they've found a way to shave another 30% off the average transaction fees Which is pretty cool to see they're saying, you know might deploy later and they think they can get the cost to transfer Eth on optimism down under a dollar. So currently it's a dollar 43 on And kind of like you can see the comparison between the different networks here between like polygon Hermes loop ring zk-sync arbitrum boba and ethereum l1 So yeah, that would be cool to see them get it under a dollar I'm sure arbitrum one once they're put in the nitro upgrade. They're gonna be reducing fees by a nice amount I saw Pauline I mentioned today that fear reduction looks to be about 50% from current levels So that would put arbitrum one, you know, basically on par with optimism I'm sure they have I'm sure they have kind of like other things up their sleeves to get fees down as well So do all the kind of like networks as I've said to you guys before It's really only the first first iterations that we're seeing of these layer twos They're gonna keep working on getting those fees down as much as possible because that really is at the end of the day I mean one of the major things that they're that they're kind of like Sorry, that's one of the kind of like main value adds right? There's the faster transactions, which is which is fine I mean as I said before it's technically not faster transactions because until your transaction is posted to l1 ethereum as a batch It's technically not confirmed Or it can I guess it's technically not finalized So it's confirmed but not finalized But you know the user experience is much better But I think that the real value prop is obviously the cheaper fees So these l2 teams obviously I'm going to be laser focused on that along with the other kind of like thing longer-term roadmap things like decentralizing out the Sequences and the network in general making sure that the network I can you know can stay alive is 99 100% of the time You know, we've seen some of the networks go offline before due to various raise various reasons out there But I obviously they're all focused on reducing the fees as much as possible So very cool to see these from optimism can't wait to see you know I'll be from nitro go live and to see how kind of like um much the fees can come down there and You know, well, I'm very curious to see what the fees are gonna look in a year for all these l2 networks Are they're gonna come down, you know less than 50 cents right for a transfer less than a dollar for a swap That would be really cool to see we're gonna have to kind of like see how that shakes out But you know for the time being I think this is pretty good I it's much better than l1 etherium, of course Obviously, you know things like swaps I guess on l1 etherium like what 50 60 bucks and I think on optimism and arbitrum They're a few dollars still or something like that. So that's an obviously massive improvements already But we can get those costs down further and further which I'm expecting You know at least over the next I guess like few years to be honest It's this stuff's not gonna just be like, oh, you know, we'll work on reducing fees over the next two months And then we're done. No, this is an ongoing thing and there's always going to be new ways that these teams fine to reduce fees There's always going to be new mechanisms that they can do. There's always going to be new tech coming out So as I said before scaling aetherium or scaling blockchains in general is like a multi-decade thing It is not something that's just gonna happen overnight and then we're gonna be able to service the world I've mentioned plenty of times that I expect these networks to be doing tens of millions of transactions per second eventually You know an aggregate across all the different networks whether it be layer twos layer one side chains or anything like that And to get to that sort of scale and to get to that sort of scale while keeping costs low And keeping these networks live so they don't kind of fall over from the demand It's going to take a while and it's going to take the concerted effort of hundreds If not thousands of very very smart people to to kind of on to get these done the funding is there like I don't think Money is a bottleneck at all for this sort for this sort of stuff The talent is definitely a bottleneck but money definitely isn't which which helps like it helps a lot right because I think that The I guess like big kind of like funds out there recognize That compute is such an in-demand resource because at the end of the day these block chains That they smart contract chains are basically just selling compute right? They're selling block space now the demand for this as I've said before is unlimited and is going to just keep expansion Exponentially increasing from here and we've seen already like plenty of evidence that people aren't just going to stick with one You know compute compute network right they're going to go Where the opportunities are they're going to go where they can afford to go as well like you know There are a lot of people who I mean most people can't afford a theorem l1 anymore And and you know we need to offer them cheaper compute that still benefits from a theorem l1 security and decentralization Which is obviously what l2 is doing But they're also using side chains and other l1 networks because the demand is just incredible right and it doesn't it's not bearish for Ethereum that these other kind of like l1 networks have um have gotten traction I don't think so at all and the funny thing is is that if you're an l1 hasn't The fees haven't gone down the activity hasn't gone down even though these other networks are getting adoption so the pie is growing And and and I think it's it's all going to grow together, and it's just a matter of you know in ten years What does the I guess some what does that? What does the distribution look like like what are the big winners like what are the top five networks in ten years are they? You know ethereum maybe one other l1 chain and the rest l2's. I don't know right. I'm betting that it's all l2's I don't know if another l1 chain Can actually exist especially in ten years can even compete with with the l2 ecosystem because these monolithic l1 chains Just aren't as scalable inherently, so we're gonna have to see how that that shakes out there But very cool to say that optimism is reducing fees even further here Stark we put an update yesterday. They presented stark net alpha 0.7.0 so new features include contract upgrade ability which is a huge thing for developers block number and block timestamp Events and much more so you can go to this blog post here to read this obviously this is for developers not really for um for end users to kind of like worry about too much, but I think that there's a A fear reduction in coming in this as well. I remember reading I remember reading something about this Which is which is really really cool, so obviously this is the sort of stuff that needs to be I know here We go initial What's coming next is initial theme mechanism support will be released in a matter of weeks as a subversion of stark net so a fee Market is going to be kind of introduced there, so very cool to see see this here as I mentioned You know yes stark net alpha went live end of November, but I said it was a very very early version It was only for developers It's not like end users were going to be getting much kind of like value out of it But there are plenty of apps live today using stock waste technology that you can go kind of like play around with and not just Absolutely whole ecosystems right like dy dx and immutable X and things like that But you can go play around with to get a teaser of what's coming with stark net But as I've mentioned before as well I've shared with you guys a list of projects building on stock net don't have it handy right now I remember sharing it maybe a couple of weeks ago But it's growing right like all these things as I said the demand for computes block spaces is basically infinite Which means that the demand to deploy kind of like applications to these networks is pretty much infinite as well And you're going to see plenty of stuff get built stuff that isn't even possible to build on layer 1 block chains Which is super super exciting? So queen base announced yesterday that they have a new partnership with MasterCard So this partnership is basically they're touting it as a way to revolutionize the NFT purchase experience For customers so essentially a MasterCard is going to classify NFTs as digital goods which allows a broader group of consumers to purchase NFTs and coming soon They'll unlock a new way to pay using a MasterCard cards here This is pretty bit a pretty big deal obviously coinbase is making a big move into the NFT ecosystem With plans to kind of like launch their own NFT marketplace now. They're partnering with MasterCard They're doing a bunch of other things around NFTs as well a lot of education around it too And kind of like signaling or doing stuff on Twitter from what I've seen Look, you know the funny thing is I've been thinking about this a lot lately and there was some FTX launched their NFT marketplace recently right that hasn't really gone anywhere from what I've seen it seems that the crypto native NFT marketplaces that don't come from centralized exchanges seem to be doing much better And you know we saw this with obviously open see now Then we saw it looks rare we saw it with a bunch of others like foundation and super rare and things like that the but but but the Centralized exchanges trying to move into the NFT game doesn't seem to be or at least anything marketplace game doesn't seem to be Making much traction. Yes doesn't mean it can't in the future But I think I mean I hope what coinbase does is that they actually move into the NFT game But act as kind of like an aggregator for things like what's available in open sea on looks rare even what's available on L tools like Albatros with the treasure kind of Marketplace on their magic whatever it's called. I think that that might be the better play, but at the end of the day I mean, I think the NFT ecosystem still has a massive amount of room to grow and actually I've got a tweet here I want to talk about and I think maybe too early to kind of like write off these centralized exchanges as being a big a big kind of like Driver of NFT adoption. I think they're still going to be because of the fact they have so many users But they have to play it right as well, so we're gonna see how that plays out But I put out this tweet today that I wanted to kind of like talk more to where I said the epic amount of hate That the NFT ecosystem gets doesn't really matter at all Just look at the growth metrics all of them are up and to the right and billion-dollar companies are investing heavily in the metaverse Random Twitter pundits with bad NFT takes are irrelevant So I want to spend a little bit of time talking about this because I think it's important to Contextualize where we are with regards to NFTs and the hate that NFTs get and hated this ecosystem gets in general So let's take a step back and take a step kind of like back in history to Bitcoin Yeah, Bitcoin in its earliest days still to this day But in its earliest days the popular consensus was that become was a scam Become was only used by criminals. It was only used to buy drugs, and it's going to zero That was the popular consensus most people believe this now look at where Bitcoin is right the fast forward What eight to ten years or whatever it's whatever it's been since then Bitcoin went from being worth less than a dollar or less than $10 to over forty thousand dollars today You know at its peak it was worth over a trillion dollars makes it one of the biggest kind of like assets in the world by market cap and that's Becoming from a place where most people thought it was legitimately a scam most people thought it was worthless and most people thought it was Just bullshit right there obviously a lot of people who still think this But you can see my point here those opinions were irrelevant Now you kind of like take NFTs in context and you apply the same kind of thing to that all the hate the literal Kind of like tens of thousands hundreds of millions of people who absolutely Despise NFTs for one reason or another the energy use reason and they get the fraud and they get the scam whatever I mean, I think a lot of these reasons that they come up with Basically a hogwash, but you know the hate is there, but look at the NFT growth look at the NFT growth The growth has been explosive 2021 was an absolutely massive year for NFTs 2022 is shaping up to be a big year again looks rare. I just launched right is doing incredible volumes OpenSea is still doing incredible bombs They just raised 300 million dollars at a 13 something billion dollar valuation all these billion dollar companies are getting involved in NFTs in the metaverse, you know yesterday we just saw Microsoft purchase Activision Blizzard for 70 billion dollars and in their press release They mentioned a metaverse prospects. We saw Facebook rebrand themselves to meta Right, like they're all these kind of like companies are getting very heavily involved So my overall point is that it's literally irrelevant what these people think because all these people do is talk they don't actually do anything when it comes to comes to kind of like Affecting change or kind of like acting on their beliefs or what they're talking about. All they do is Commentate on things they just talk talk talk. They hate hate hate and they don't do anything They don't add any kind of like value. They don't try to change anything They don't try to make anything a better experience for people They just love to hate and as I as I use the Bitcoin example And even the etherium example if you're himself at the same thing for a while and there's so many examples of this It just didn't matter at all and I don't think it's gonna matter for NFT So I think whenever you see these bad takes on on Twitter and you might be and other places and you may be getting frustrated By it, but the popular consensus is that like it's all worthless and if these are scams It's you know, it's killing the planet all this sorts of stuff. Just remember that While you can't win a narrative war As in you can you can't fight back against this because like it's a very popular kind of narrative The the thing is is that if something actually has true value to a large number of people Doesn't matter what anyone says unless it's like outright banned like by global governments everywhere. It's going to keep going It's going to keep getting traction. It's going to keep providing value to people. It doesn't matter what others say, you know, it's funny I remember reading kind of like and still to this day if you go outside the crypto bubble and you read about crypto not NFTs but like other kind of like crypto things like Bitcoin and etherium outside of the bubble There are still plenty of people who think that it's either a get-rich-quick Get-rich-quick scheme or is a scam or is providing no value to people or is using too much energy which to be fair I mean obviously choosing a lot of energy right and if you're him is guilty of that too But we're moving to proof of stake can't wait for that day But when you really kind of like take this all in context you realize that All of this doesn't matter right people people can talk as much as they want But what really matters is the reality of the situation and the reality is that NFTs are not going anywhere massive billion dollar companies Multi, I mean, you know hundred plus billion dollar companies trillion dollar come back Microsoft's a trillion dollar company these companies are getting heavily heavily involved in this industry because they see the future They see and they're taking action. They're not just talking about it They're taking action whereas the people who hate NFTs they take no action. They do nothing they put together Twitter threads They hate on everyone trying to do NFTs With you know whether it's warranted or not most of the time. It's not warranted and from that perspective I would say just ignore them. They're irrelevant. Don't don't listen to them Just keep doing what you're doing whether you're involved in an NFT project whether you're thinking of minting your own NFTs to to do Stuff I mean, you know, we we minted their daily way and if T's and we donated most of the proceeds to eat core devs There's a lot of good that comes out of this stuff and I think that people will realize that over time I think that the sentiment will shift over time But it's just we have to keep building where we have to keep doing these things and the NFT people and the NFT ecosystem is Building they're not just talking about it They're building the future that they want to see and if people adopt it They adopt it people get allowed to do whatever they want with their money in their time Like the fact that some people think they can control what other people do is is quite crazy to me But that's the kind of like a world we live in but yeah, I'll leave it at that But that's just kind of some some I guess like NFT in context talk that I wanted to kind of bring up there And last thing about NFTs was that OpenSea today announced that they have acquired a Dharma So this is pretty pretty big. I think Dom has been around for quite a while now They were an ethereum wallet from very early on that tried to do a lot of DeFi stuff I think from 2018 they've been around so I'm now they're joining kind of like the OpenSea family I'm sure OpenSea is going to tap into Dhamma's kind of like wallet and mobile wallet experience here too. I guess some Kind of like bring that to the OpenSea app and things like that. I believe Dharmas CEO is actually becoming or this the CTO of OpenSea, which is pretty cool. So it's basically an aqua hire I don't think it was disclosed how much this kind of like aqua hire was for But I'm sure I'm sure it was for a decent amount here because as I said Dhamma's been around for quite a while They've been doing a lot of really great stuff and now they're joining the OpenSea family So you can kind of see a bit of a thread and a blog post about this if you want to read more info and dive Deeper into this I'll link this in the YouTube description below So POOP announced today that they have raised ten million dollars in a seed funding round now Of course full disclosure here I participated in this round as a strategic angel investor and I mean How couldn't I write like pop is one of my favorite projects in the crypto ecosystem? I've talked about them lots of times before I'm sure all of you have at least one power I'm sure many of you have lots of them I mean, especially the people that are big kind of like rocker pool fans and rocker pool community members I know you guys are really big fans of pops and you guys created one for me when I jumped in there with my I know when you guys found out that I had about an issue with my validator. That was just like a really silly issue So so yeah, but no this is this is really awesome. I'm going I'm scrolling down here to To the information about the rays. I had around the round was basically led by archetype and sapphire sport LLC with participation from a bunch of other web 3 native funds like 1k X and six-man ventures and Delphi digital a capital here and then Around 50 strategic angels participated as well. They're not named here But as I said, I invested as part of this round now What I like about this blog post is most of it focuses on what pop is The vision for what they want to be how they're going to get there You know what? What they what they kind of like see being the most value out of pop and everything like that Rather than the fund raise itself. So this is really really cool. I really really love this I really love that they focused on this sort of stuff and Focused on kind of like the value add rather than just like the money that I raised because obviously the money that I raised is awesome like Ten million dollars is gonna give them a lot of runway to do what they want to do and to build what they want to build but the real kind of like The really important thing is focusing on the actual products that they're building right the actual value that they're adding to The ecosystem to end users and there's a lot of value here I mean I think identity in general is going to become a very big deal going forward and I've talked I spoken about this before with projects Like starting with aetherium and and sismo and and and get coins doing a lot of stuff here but basically on chain identity is still a relatively unsolved kind of like Problem and it's something that needs to to have a lot of focus on it because if we're all going to live online Which we do already but if we're going to live in kind of like this metaverse whether it be you know Actually in the metaverse with VR goggles or whether it's just kind of like existing online We need a way to kind of like have this identity where we protect our identity But still have an online kind of like presence like that But you know still have privacy and all that sorts of stuff there and pop is playing a big big role there because of things Like, you know I mean pop stands for as you guys know proof of attendance protocol and just like the basic primitive of being able to kind of like prove that you were somewhere prove that you attended that attended an Event or prove something through an NFT through a pop is awesome and you could even kind of I guess You can you can kind of like extend this with thumb with sismo where essentially if you have pull-ups on on a wallet That you don't want to be public but you want to prove to people that you have this pop Well, you can use this mode to do this because then you can basically say, okay Well, here's a zero knowledge proof that I actually own this pop on another address that I own But I'm not going to tell you what the address is because I want to keep that private But here's you know cryptographic proof that I actually own it So all of these things are blending together and we're actually going to get I think to a point Where we actually build out the full identity stack in a really nice decentralized proper way Using the tools that have been around for a while as I said like power sign them with a furium sismo There's a few others out there Like that they come under the get coin umbrella or at least a part not a part of get coin But like work with get coin like proof of humanity and stuff like that And I think once we kind of like solve that it just like opens the floodgates to to everything else So yeah, once again, congrats the pop on this raise very happy to be part of this myself as well And I'm very much looking forward to seeing what they do are going forward So speaking of rocker pool just before they put out some stats today So a busy two weeks for rocker pool the RE supply has grown by eight point six nine percent Which is a two hundred and twenty six percent annualized growth rate node operator count has grown by about the same amount almost nine percent The mini pool count has grown by about the same amount there and the effective RPL staked has grown by about nine point two percent So very very nice to see this, you know, I was having a brief discussion in the discord channel today about Staking on your own and staking as a kind of like rocker pool node and I think Tom decent I think I think his name is was I was saying that you can earn a lot more staking through rocker pool than you can Kind of like staking on your own validator because you get the kind of like RPL on top of it now I was kind of saying that it's kind of apples to origins comparison because there is extra risk by using rocker pool instead of staking on your own But the thing is is that you know, how big is the risk like for me personally? The risk is still too large just just just for me personally and and but the fact is like I have the 32 e Necessary to stake on my own. So for me, it's a bit of a different kind of like thing to think about but if you don't have the 32 if necessary to stake and you only have the Just kind of like um, just like on your own then rocker pools obviously the solution for you But I think what Tom was was comparing was 32 e in in both scenarios where with the rocker pool one You would stake 16 e and then 16 e worth of With a rocker pool, I believe and then you get kind of like you make more money from doing that But you also take on the extra risk and this is not to say that rocker pool is a risky project Or is that bad bad project or is you're gonna lose all your money or anything like that? But anytime you introduced any new kind of like mechanisms or contracts or anything you do take on the additional risk So just you just need to be aware of that But I mean the amount of I can't remember the exact numbers off the top of my head But the amount of difference between staking on your own is taking with rocker pool right now is quite large So it would definitely make sense if you're looking to stake to go through rocker pools So jumping to I can't remember what channel was in in the discord channel Probably the e2 channel or something like that probably jump into there and find the conversation to see the numbers around that but yeah, it's been it's been great to see rocker pool continue to grow here and Opening the decentralized staking up to a much wider set of participants Not just those who can kind of like afford it with the 32 a thumb requirement there So David Mihal announced yesterday that he is building a new kind of I guess like website or a new service called Cryptostats, so he's building this here with Mike and could that what crypto set is aiming to be is an aggregate data It's aiming to aggregate data for every useful crypto magic metric ensure The data is trustworthy and make it available to all now you guys will probably be aware of David I've talked about him a few times on the refuel He's the guy behind crypto fees dot info and a bunch of other websites like l2 fees dot info and money movers dot info Very popular websites. I use them all the time and now he's launching the crypto stats with Mike and basically as I said Like crypto stats is aiming to aggregate data data for all useful crypto metrics You can kind of like jump into the blog post here for more details about what they're trying to do But essentially this is kind of like the stack right you have blockchains and protocols Like aetherium and Bitcoin and polygon then you have indexes like Azirion the graph coin metrics then you have the normalization of this kind of like data are with crypto stats and then That that's kind of like where they sit and then this data can be presented as part of kind of like you know Crypto fees or Bloomberg or wherever else wherever else So basically just giving a really easy way for all the for anyone to tap into But basically all these different various crypto metrics, which I think is a really really cool So if you want to kind of like get started with this or I mean it because it's live today and you're kind of like A developer you can go check this out. They've already got a NSDK going as I said It's already live and they've got a bunch of different metrics that you can tap into and there's resources and a disco channel all that Good stuff in the blog post. I'll link this in the YouTube description and you can go check it out for yourself but I guess congrats to David and Mike here for for launching this very very excited to see where they go with this and Finally Arbutrum put out a tweet today saying that they are hiring So just wanted to give a quick shout out here that I mean technically off-chain labs is hiring the team behind Arbutrum But you can go here to jobs dot lever dot co slash off-chain labs and check out all the positions Of course, there's a building to the YouTube description There seems to be something for everyone here or at least for most people so you can see here that they're looking for a partnerships Manager in the business development field here and then looking for a bunch of engineers So any type of like software security engineers, but DevOps engineer and even a web developer So if you fit into any of these kind of roles here definitely apply Because I mean who wouldn't want to work for an L2 team, right? Like I think you know The funny thing is I think if I wasn't doing what I'm doing and I was kind of like wanting to work within You know work a normal job within kind of like the web3 crypto Ethereum ecosystem I would definitely land at an add a layer to kind of like team that I mean I think that I would be kind of like be the coolest place to work as you're on like the bleeding edge of one Of the biggest I guess like issues that need to be solved within the Ethereum ecosystem And you get to kind of like provide a crap ton of value to people because at the end of the day The most people are going to I mean all everyone is going to be on boarding on layer twos and you can have a direct Impact on people and people's experiences are using that infrastructure So yeah, anyway, definitely go check out all of these roles you can apply on on this website here But I think that's going to be it for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel If you haven't yet give the video a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the disco channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone

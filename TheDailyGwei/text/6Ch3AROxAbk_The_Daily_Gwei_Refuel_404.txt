 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Deli Bay Refuel. Where we cap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, Dan this is a sign-on as of the 12th of July 2022. Alright everyone, let's get into it. So this morning I woke up and had a little mini heart attack. Because I woke up and I read this tweet from CZ at Binance which reads, Our threat intel detected a potential exploit on Uniswap v3 on the Ethereum blockchain. The hacker has stolen 4295 ETH so far and they are being laundered through tornado cash. Can someone notify Uniswap? We can help, thanks. So I think the reasons are obvious why I had a little mini heart attack here. It's simply because if there actually was an exploit with Uniswap v3, it would be very very bad for very obvious reasons right. Now the TLDR here is that there was no exploit with Uniswap v3. It was basically a phishing attack and you can actually check out this thread from Harry here, who works for security at Metamask, into how this attack actually happened. So it has nothing to do with the Uniswap protocol itself. It was basically a phishing attack here. Now CZ was being grossly irresponsible by tweeting this out and their threat intel team seems to be kind of incompetent if they were so quick to blame Uniswap rather than blame Uniswap the protocol rather than realizing that this was actually a phishing attempt here. And then CZ saying stuff like we can help is also silly because if Uniswap protocol itself was actually exploited then no one can help because they're fully decentralized, immutable smart contracts on Ethereum. And that's why, as I said earlier, why this would be so bad is because if there was an actual exploit the only recourse would be people having to kind of like take out or withdraw their funds from Uniswap otherwise the attacker if there was an exploit for them to drain funds from the protocol itself they could potentially drain most if not all of the funds depending on what the kind of exploit was. But there was no exploit with the protocol. It was a phishing attack which we've seen time and time again within crypto and even outside of crypto. I mean you guys know I used to work in cyber security. Phishing was like the thing because that is the easiest way to get access to something you want to get access to whether it's targeted phishing at individuals, whether it's casting a wide net and just sending all these spam emails to people and hoping that they click something and download something for you to get control of the device. This is nothing new in the kind of like world of cyber security. So the fact that Binance's threat intel team didn't pick up on this and straight away went to oh Uniswap v3 must be exploited. Yeah it's a really bad look in my eyes right. And obviously CZ tweeting this out was grossly irresponsible. I don't know if I'd blame it for the sell-off. I did make a joke about it saying you know thanks CZ for making the market go into poverty again. But I don't know if I blame that for that. The markets are weak right now in general. So it's kind of like I mean maybe the timing lined up a bit maybe it affected the UNI token. I think it did but like the wider market eh I don't know I don't think so. I think the wider market just is weak right now anyway. But regardless of that as I said you can check out this thread from Harry here for a full breakdown of kind of like how this attack actually works and it's quite sophisticated and quite I guess quite scary as well because it was able to spoof a few things that on etherscan. So for example he says here and Harry says here the malicious contract pollutes the event data so that block explorers index the from as the legitimate Uniswap v3 positions NFT contract. So that's probably what the threat intel team looked at and they're like oh my god like this is actually coming from the official Uniswap contracts. You know this looks really really bad when in reality as I said it pollutes as Harry said here pollutes the event data and basically spoofs that it's coming from the original from the legitimate Uniswap v3 kind of like data here. So again that's why you can't as I said before trust block explorers 100% they're good but they can also be tricked into various things. The only thing you can really trust to verify things for you is your I guess your own ethereum node and about my enhances threat intel team should have their own ethereum nodes both full and archive nodes and should have quick access to query them if they're a proper intel team. I don't want to bash them too much here but I just think what CZ tweeted out was just stupidly irresponsible like it's this is this is the kind of stuff that can be considered FUD right like people always go on about FUD this FUD that in reality a lot of the time it's not actual FUD it's just them you know reading or hearing something that they don't personally agree with or like but this is actual FUD. This is really bad information completely wrong information being put out there by someone who people kind of like look up to and respect and expect not to put out these this kind of information. So CZ doing this without checking is just really bad this is not the first time he's done this he's done this in the past as well and it's not just him right there's a lot of people out there who do this but you know I think that people you know media would have run with this and you know people would have run with this and many people didn't see Harry's kind of like tweet here and then other people kind of like calling this out and only saw CZ's tweet and thought that Uniswap on ethereum you know was exploited and was exploited and maybe sold the uni tokens or sold their ETH because of it whatever right like this is a material kind of like information and putting out really bad information like this is is just is not great right so I just kind of like wanted to highlight that that there maybe you disagree with me on this but yeah I just think it was grossly responsible for CZ to do this but anyway that's the kind of like recap of what happened there as I said not an exploit with Uniswap at all with Uniswap smart contracts at all an ex it wasn't an exploit really at all it was just a phishing attack I mean I say just a phishing attack like it's nothing major obviously it was because a lot of ETH was kind of like phished here but definitely kind of like not as bad as Uniswap's contracts themselves being exploited right anyway I'm going to move on from that got a bunch of other things to get through so Len's Troop was released today or revealed today so Stani kind of like quote tweeted Len's Troop's tweet by saying Len's Troop is here all content stored on is stored on our wave and exciting features by Len's protocol such as pay to subscribe collect videos and mirror your favorite contact to your audience powered also by live PR this is really cool this is bringing together a bunch of different protocols on top of Len's right and you guys know that I've talked about Len's protocol a bunch before and the reason why I'm so excited about it is because Len's is just a set of primitives it's not this big monolithic thing that he's trying to be this big decentralized network and and kind of like do it all themselves they've just got like a set of primitives that anyone can kind of tap into and build on and then you can bring things together so what's happened with Len's Troop is that they're building on Len's protocol but they're also leveraging our way for kind of like data storage content storage and live PR for video transcoding which I think is really really cool now this isn't to say anything about the sustainability of a solution like this I have gone on kind of like a record on the refill before and we discussed this in this the discord channel the other day that I believe platforms like rweave are going to long term suffer with sustainability because of the fact that it is not cheap to store content store data and we were discussing in the discord channel about this with regards to something like call data call data and data availability on block on on a blockchain is very very different to storing data such as videos and images on a blockchain they're totally separate things call data is not I mean it it's still kind of like it's still heavier data than a normal kind of like transaction and that's why L2s are so expensive right now because it costs a lot to store that data but the thing is is that actual data like videos and images are much much bigger than that so you have to store them somewhere right and storing them on rweave or filecoin or some other solution is not cheap and the way that the payment is done for people to kind of like validate on the network to provide storage on the network is through the native token that's why these tokens they've been kind of like especially with something like like filecoin they've been they've been basically taking on the cost themselves so they're being inflated away and the the the way it's being paid for is via those tokens right not just for the security but also for the fact that they've got to keep the data available they've got to keep the data online they've got to store it and and storage you know storage is relatively cheap but not when you're trying to store like terabytes hundreds of terabytes petabytes worth of data which is exactly what would be what would be needed to do a proper decentralized file storage solution now obviously the long-term goal is to make it so that people that are storing data will pay fees to do it right and the fees would make up for the the the kind of like um i guess inflation and then inflation would subside and fees would take over but that requires offering a better solution that will them already exist with something like amazon aws for example right now i know you know obviously these other things like rweave and filecoin are trying to be decentralized but it their demand is just not there yet hope maybe you know in the future it will be there obviously peer-to-peer file sharing is big as well but i i think with peer-to-peer file sharing you don't have to necessarily pay for anything right you can pay to be part of like private um kind of like groups where you get better access to better seating and things like that but uh sorry better peers and things like that but generally most people that are kind of like using peer-to-peer is to kind of like um uh pirate things and it's it's it's pretty much free for most people so that's a different kind of like set of set of um i guess uh set of things like i guess uh things compared to something like an amazon aws or a dropbox or anything like that any of those these kind of like file storage solutions so until something like rweave and filecoin competes with that it's probably going to be just like a niche thing here and they're probably going to have to keep paying out uh you know these validators out of kind of like uh token inflation so that's why the tokens pretty much are down only here but i went off on a little bit of a tangent there um lens tube itself looks very interesting i think obviously as a youtube content creator i do worry about my content being removed or my account being banned for whatever reason obviously i don't monetize any of the daily waste stuff but even if i don't monetize anything there's still a risk of me being removed or censored or anything like that whereas lens tube is obviously trying to be an alternative here where you can kind of upload uh your videos are here and it's all plugged into kind of like lens protocol you can see here there's already a bunch of videos on here and you can publish and post basically whatever you want uh and and plug in be interoperable with all the other lens protocol uh kind of like apps out there so i think it's very cool obviously very very early days this reminds me of like the early youtube days really at the end of the day the interfaces may be better but in terms of kind of like overall ux and ui still a ways to go but it's great to see something like this that exists and i believe it's it's built on the polygon pos chain uh because of the fact that lens protocol is built on there so very cool to see more use happening there of polygon all right so arbitrum introduced arbitrum nova today which is a new chain built on arbitrums any trust technology that optimizes for ultra low cost transactions with strong security guarantees mainnet is now open for developers to start building ahead of opening up to end users so arbitrum nova i guess is the second uh mainnet product from arbitr the i guess offchain labs team uh which develops the arbitrum technology obviously the first one is arbitrum one which is the layer 2 network the the optimistic roll-up that we all know and love uh but arbitrum nova is trying to be something more like a a validity or something more like a postal data offchain post your proof to ethereum uh but trying to do it in the optimistic roll-up sense now there is a few architecture changes here and there are kind of like um uh kind of like things that that differ in terms of security guarantees and trade-offs and stuff like that you can definitely read the thread and the blog post for a deep dive on that but it seems that you could kind of like summarize arbitrum nova if i'm getting this right as an optimistic validity where you basically optimistically kind of like assume that the data will be will be available uh and then uh kind of like there's there's fraud checking and things like that but i mean i haven't really had a chance to dive deep into this just yet so i don't want to go much further than there in terms of kind of like the technical differences and how it all works under the hood but it's cool to see this i think that people kind of like it's kind of like hard right now right like this is a bigger kind of like discussion that i maybe want to dive dive into a little bit here around scaling generally i think that there was obviously from i guess the start of defi summer to maybe the end of 2021 or early 2022 there was this massive push for scale right because of the fact that ethereum's fees were persistently very very high it basically priced out all the new users because a lot of new users didn't make money on uh kind of like eth and they they didn't want to pay the fees and stuff like that and they felt it was like a highway robbery or whatever layer 2 solutions weren't live until really the end of 2021 or kind of like you know q late q3 into q4 and still coming online obviously this year as well and then yeah there was this massive kind of like push to to scale and all these different solutions came online there were roll-ups zk roll-ups optimistic roll-ups there were validity ems uh there were things like um volitions there were uh different kind of like flavors of zk roll-ups different flavors of optimistic roll-ups different uh kind of like uh things like the polygon pos chain obviously alternative layer ones and then now you know things like arbitrum nova nova so there's this kind of like wide spectrum of scalability solutions that are trying to do things as cheaply as possible and as securely as possible now if you want maximum security you're always going to have to go for a roll-up on ethereum that's going to give you maximum security because both the data and the uh kind of proof is posted to ethereum layer one so you get ethereum you inherit ethereum layer one security but there are also kind of things around that like if there's training wheels on the protocol such as admin keys and centralization at various aspects which there are for pretty much all of them you know i'm talking about in their end state like a roll-up is your maximum security then you have the validity ems of the world where the data is stored off chain but the proof is still stored on chain so that if the data is lost uh you still you can't access your funds no one can access their their kind of like funds but the funds can't be stolen so it's kind of like a trade-off there as well but that that trade-off means that the cost is much much lower than a roll-up because the data is the expensive part of a roll-up and uh obviously we won't be getting something like proto-dank sharding until hope you know i mean hoping q2 next year and that's what collapses the cost for roll-up so in the meantime we've needed all these kind of like spectrum of solutions and obviously the alternative layer ones got their time in the sun as well because there were massive incentive programs and the layer one trade was a big thing especially in the second half of last year so because of that i think people are kind of still really confused and still kind of like in the dark about what's going to win i wouldn't say i have all the answers my bet is obviously that roll-ups are going to win long term because of the fact they're going to get so cheap that nothing else can compete in terms of like security and um kind of like uh i guess like what's the word i'm looking for um diversity of of kind of like options for builders and developers at the end of the day but in the meantime and probably for the foreseeable future and probably for the next next couple of years probably at least even if we do get proto-dank sharding q2 q3 next year at least for the next couple of these solutions are going to be very popular for those use cases that require like lots and lots i'm talking tens of thousands of transactions per second from maybe big companies that want to deploy their own chain or deploy something especially in the gaming world that these solutions are going to exist and they will build network effects i mean a polygon pls chain is not technically a layer to it is not a roll-up it has its own validators um it is basically referred to as a commit chain um but you know it's definitely not a roll-up it's definitely not something that is as secure as a roll-up but it's very popular because it was there it was ready they had they did a lot of good business development around it they did a lot of good marketing they got a lot of apps on there now they do have plans to i guess change that to a roll-up eventually but we don't know when that's going to happen uh and i guess like right now i mean there's no point doing it unless the roll-up is in a state where it makes sense to do that as well so there are all these kind of like wide breadth of solutions that are going to exist on with scalability there are going to be different trade-offs and i don't think that roll-ups will be kind of like the grand winner for a while but they will be the the winner long term i do think that most activity on encrypto will be on roll-ups in terms of like execution settlement i believe will be on ethereum obviously but in terms of activity on the execution layer side of things i definitely think roll-ups are going to be long term the big winner now short to medium term it's it's hard to kind of like know but i would put our money on these other kind of solutions being big winners because of the fact that they're just simply cheaper until we get cheaper call data on ethereum layer one which comes with the dank sharding effort and all the parts that fall into that as well but cool to see this from arbitrum definitely go check it out if you haven't already all right so speaking of polygon they have a major announcement happening today around the kind of like they're kind of like zk tech here so this is pulling in all of their zk teams i believe which is really really cool to see and this is going to be happening at 9 p.m uh indian standard time which i think is uh india standard time which i think is three hours from when i'm recording this so you may have already seen the announcements but if you haven't yet or if you're watching this uh i think this will go live before this this kind of like announcement happens here um then yeah definitely tune into this but if you have already seen the announcement i'm sure it's something very cool i'll discuss it on tomorrow's refill of course but just wanted to give a heads up to everyone that there will be an announcement today from polygon about their zk tech which they've been teasing this zk avm thing for a little while now i'm very curious to see what they have here you guys know i'm an advisor to polygon but i don't have any insider knowledge on this or any kind of like knowledge ahead of time on this i don't know what they've cooked up here i'm as excited as i'm sure a lot of you guys are to see what this is all right so chris here from the l2b team has put together a nice thread where he starts off by saying i synchronize arbitrum and optimism rollups full nodes optimism was done after only two and a half days but arbitrum took a whole three weeks to synchronize what's going on here and he kind of explains exactly why this is the case in his little mini thread here but the tldr is that arbitrum needs the arbitrum nitro upgrade is going to bring that sync time down dramatically because it's going to get arbitrum closer or arbitrum is going to be a little bit more effective to get it, but then the second thing is that arbitrum is going to be leveraging the battle tested geth code base the same way optimism is or in a similar way that optimism is today but although this was cool because this is not something that many people talk about that there are full nodes that exist for optimism and arbitrum because they are essentially blockchains they're just blockchains that outsource their security to ethereum so all the same things apply here in terms of being able to sync the chain being able to sync the chain in a timely manner Geth has obviously been optimized over many many years to be very easy to sync same with a few of the other kind of like execution layer nodes out there, so Leveraging that technology for things like roll-ups is definitely something that needs to be done Because two or three weeks to synchronize an arbitrum node at this point in time even though arbitrum is only I think arbitrum is About 35% more transactions than optimism obviously is way too long But as I said once nitro comes out Which hopefully will be soon then that kind of like time to synchronize will hopefully get more in line with what optimism has here and Over time that will either stay you know stay the same get a bit longer come down It's kind of like this cat and mouse game if it gets long then we implement some kind of like things to get it down Again, and then there's also different ways to prune the chain or kind of like different sync modes And that's all going to come, but I thought this was just like a really interesting little thread I just wanted to highlight it for you guys. You can check it out. It'll be linked in the YouTube description All right, so it's kind of funny that this was the way the stock net token was confirmed But suzu tweeted out a bunch a couple of emails here got to do with Three hours capital was a stark net token warrants now for those of you who don't know Start sorry three hours capital was an investor in stock where I think in two separate rounds And obviously that gives them the rights to exercise For token what I thought for tokens now stock net token wasn't confirmed yet So that's why I thought I said that this was a funny way to confirm the stock net token How because of the fact that suzu is basically showing these emails now? What are these emails? Well, basically what happened is that three hours capital or three hours cap the people that three hours capital delegated the responsibility to Failed to actually exercise these token warrants in time which was by July 5th And now they're not going to be able to get their stock net token So these emails basically show them show I guess like their lawyers I think Trying to kind of like figure out what went wrong here kind of like what's going on here with this exercise option But basically it's funny because like if it needed to be exercised by July 5th It probably means a stock net token is coming relatively soon and obviously it also confirms that a stock net token is coming But we also already knew that like I've said to you guys before everything's gonna have a token This is just another one that is confirmed here But I just wanted to highlight that because I thought it was a very funny way to kind of like announce a token or it's kind Of like reveal that there's going to be a kind of like token here that we all knew was coming anyway But just wanted to give a quick brief update there on that one. I'm not sure if there'll be more and you see I think this is the first tweet that suzu has put out since yeah since his last one on June 15th So almost a month after he put out a tweet where he said that three hours capital were communicating with parties to pay them back He tweeted this out and obviously, you know, you've probably read about the fact that they've been quote unquote on the run No one can kind of like locate them. No one knows where suzu and Carl Davies are right now So it's a bit of a bizarre turn of events that he would tweet out There's a couple of images of emails about the stock where token warrants or the stock net token warrants here But anyway, it's there It's I guess like a do some juicy information some some alpha leak from suzu suzu alpha leaking from From the grave so to speak for obviously three hours capital is done. Um, but it's kind of funny that he's just still leaking alpha here But yeah, cool to see that. It's actually being confirmed. Maybe stark where we'll be doing a press release in the coming weeks We'll have to see what happens there All right. So speaking of tokens our connects are announced that they were going to do a token a few weeks ago called next I think a few months ago at this stage and they put out an update yet today where they said Given recent market conditions and volatility we have decided to delay our token distribution temporarily below You'll find the reasons behind the decision and the next steps we are putting in place the transition connects into a dow Disclosure I'm an investor in connects just want to get that out there But yeah I mean I always find it funny when token launches get delayed due to unfavorable market conditions because it makes sense right you want To launch your token in a strong market. You don't necessarily want to launch it into a weak market But I've discussed this before In detail, so I'm not gonna rehash it here, but I've talked about how token launches are really hard to do normally But I actually think launching in a bear market is better than launching in a bull market And I mean the TLDR of that thinking is that there's less speculators in a bear market you get the tokens into I guess more of the long-term Contributors hands and there's less speculation or when the token actually goes live But I kind of get the reasoning here and there is a thread that explains why I think it's important to look at tokens And there is a thread that explains more in depth about the reason It's not just because of unfavorable market conditions But it's also about kind of like how it plays into the protocol and the Dow itself so you can give this a read I'll link it in the YouTube description below for you Alright so Bert Miller from the flashbots team is calling all validators to test MEV boost So MEV will be an important part of validator rewards up to the merge our early Exploration showed it could increase rewards by 70% So basically this is for salt the solo stakeholders out there those of you who run your own Nodes if you don't run your own nodes And you're delegating to some some other kind of like node out there whether that's through decentralized or centralized staking pool providers or liquid Staking providers, then you will be reliant on them running MEV boost now MEV boost is basically the proof of stake version of MEV kind of like um Boost that's run on the execution layer today where MEV is collected. It's basically the same thing. It's just for the consensus layer instead Because of the fact that we you know post merge the rewards we're going to validate instead of miners So if you want to test this you can But as I said I mean you the thing is you can test this as part of kind of like your I think main Validates, but also on the test net as well So if you are solo staking you probably get involved here and just like for any of you solo stakers out there in general You should be running this anyway like on your validator like I'm planning to get this set up on mine before the merge happens Because I mean this is gonna substantially increase your amounts of reward You're literally leaving money on the table if you don't do this so to give it a raid find out what it's all about in More detail and hopefully you'll be able to give it a test as well Alright, so lifi or lifi protocol here announced that they have raised a five point five million dollar strategic round led by 1k X now disclosure I participated in this round because as I said to you guys before I think bridges are going to be a huge thing in kind of like um In crypto generally I think that they're going to exist both for cross chain and multi chain so cross chain being crossed like l1 Multi chain being across L 2's right so I participated in this round because what lifi does is it basically Aggregates these bridge solutions together and kind of allows people to get the best liquidity across Different kind of like chains and different sorry different bridges so cool to say that that this is finally public this raise actually happened a Little while ago, but I guess it's cool to say that it's finally public here And I'm very happy to be backing them they've done a lot of great work And they continue to do a lot of great work so congrats to them on this race here it also had participation from other well-known invention other well-known investors in the space such as Dragonfly capital Scalar capital and Coinbase ventures which a bunch of others there and a lot of angels I think 90 angels participated in this round as well, so you can go check out this thread for more details I'll link it in the description God this is going to be funny. This is another thing that was revealed today that I'm An investor in as well just getting that out there, but anyway alpha day is now the landing page is now live So what alpha day is trying to be is like a one-stop tool to basically stay up to date with everything happening in crypto So basically an interface for you to keep track of what's happening in crypto not just on chain But off chain as well obviously we have things like Zappa and Zirion Which I'm of course big fans of but alpha day is going kind of like in a different direction where it's not really Too much about tracking your portfolio and tracking your positions and things like that which it does have that I mean you can say that On the screenshot here But it's also about aggregating things like news events you know dowels like voting on it within kind of like different Dowels and voting on different proposals also market information Crypto Twitter and a whole bunch of different things and the way it works is that there's going to be a bunch of modules that you Can kind of like plug-and-play and things like that it's kind of like the Bloomberg terminal for for crypto Which I thought was really really cool And that's obviously why I participated as an investor in the kind of like round here. It's not live yet This is just their landing page, and they're kind of like official reveal here So you can definitely follow them on Twitter to get to get updates when they put them out there But yeah, I just thought it was really really cool when it was first showed to me I actually a little while ago was first showed to me, and it seems to have evolved a lot It looks a lot better than the other than the kind of like first iterations that I saw obviously But yeah, I think this is just really cool like as I said guys like I use Zappa like every day pretty much Because of the fact that it just gives me so much really good information And I do find it hard sometimes as a person who covers the news to aggregate a lot of things together especially things from like My emails news more generally crypto Twitter and keep track of all the events happening And having like a calendar there having it all in one dashboard I think this would be really cool because I have actually two monitors that sit in front of me. I have my big Monitor in front of me. I have a 49 inch the Samsung ultra wide It's the best monitor I've ever owned by the way quick plug there I'm not sponsoring me, but like literally best monitor I've ever owned But then I got another top one at 34 inch ultra wide on top of it that I usually have like charts on and things Like that that would be the perfect place to put something like this right like you put a dashboard up there be able to track Everything I can have market market stuff there if I want to but I can also have events and news I can kind of like keep track of it in real time without having to kind of like do the ad hoc stuff that I Do today, so that's that's kind of like you know one of the reasons I'm definitely super interested in it and And you can also create your own widgets as it says here as well right like that's what I like about this these modules these widgets Are not going to be something that's just to provide it by the kind of like company building alpha day But it's also it's also going to be something that people can kind of like tap into as well and build their own so really really Cool to see more information. Hopefully we'll be out about this soon, but you can go follow alpha day HQ on Twitter to follow all their updates Alright last couple of things to get through so super fears shared some great I guess a theorem staking resources today on Twitter you should definitely check out I'm just gonna leave this in the YouTube description for you obviously aspiring solo steak is out there This would be of interest to you But even if you're not aiming to be a solo steak and even if you don't want to be a solo steak this is still Of interest to you because it will show you other ways to stake whether that's the rocker pool or lido or other kind of like Solutions out there and whether they be centralized exchanges there are many many different ways to stake and these guides help you to choose You know what you should stake with or what is best for you obviously if you want you can go the full nine yards and become a full sovereign solo staker at home I mean obviously I highly recommend it all of my staking is done through solo staking right now I actually do plan to set up a rocker pool mini node eventually hopefully sooner rather than later I mean to do it, but this week's been kind of busy. It's my 30th birthday on Saturday, so this week I'm just kind of like trying to get all this stuff done because having people over but anyway That's a bit too much life story there, but I am planning to kind of like spin up that kind of like rocker pool node Like very soon hopefully rock for me no, but generally I am like a full self sovereign solos They got all my validators are run on my own staking PC that used to sit behind me you probably saw it in my older videos But you don't have to do that guys just because like I'm doing it or other people doing it doesn't mean you have to do It there are there are solutions out there and especially decentralized solutions like rocker pool out there that will allow you to still do At home staking without having to have that 32 requirement and also that could be dropped more like the mini pool allows you to kind of Like do it with with kind of like less 8 I think it's like 16 8 But then you can kind of like and rocker pool wants to drop that even further and then obviously if you've only got like one Or two eat or something like that you can put that into something to rock a pool as well You can just go buy our a tokens for example Or you and then you can kind of like still be staking technically right so there are many different Solutions out there, but definitely check out these resources from super fears. I'll link him in the YouTube description Alright finally here just a shout out that I'm the merge series that I'm doing with SSV network We're having another kind of like interview here on the Twitter spaces here on July 15th at 11 a.m. UTC which is I think 8 p.m. My time Australian Eastern Standard Time which would be around lunchtime in Europe and early morning in the US This one will be from with vito.

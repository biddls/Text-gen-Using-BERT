 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the deadly gray refuel worry cap the latest news near theorem ecosystem I'm your host Anthony sasano and there's the 14th of February 2022 right everyone that let's get into it So just a quick heads up here You've probably been hearing about dank sharding lately a lot of the smartest folks in a theorem are talking about it I've spoken about it on the refuel before and you're probably confused as to exactly what it is there It doesn't seem to be an explained like I'm five about it yet I know Pauline I wrote a blog post about it But that is definitely not an explained like I'm five nor did they intend it to be but if you are still confused about dank sharding why people are excited about it and you want to learn more then definitely go to This kind of like events or if it's already happened You can probably watch a recording of it The EF research team is hosting at this educational seminar with researchers and core devs on on dank sharding on February 14th at 1430 UTC which is in the future from when I'm recording but not by too much by the time you watch this is it's It's more than likely already over But the thing is you can view the agenda here this link will be linked in YouTube description And I'm sure there'll be a recording for you to kind of like have a look at after so I am sure this is going to Eliminate a lot about dank sharding. It's gonna maybe not give you an explain like I'm five But at least kind of like we have give you more information to go off of and I guess just on at the highest level here dank sharding is just the name for a new kind of like sharding design that Dan Cradfice the researcher at the Ethereum Foundation Came up with and a lot of people are very very excited about this. It's a simplified sharding proposal It allows for much better I think interoperability from what I understand a much better scalability for layer twos And you know that as I said like the the smartest people I know are excited about it So I'm excited about it but I just wanted to kind of give a shout here because I know people are wondering and want to want to learn more about this and as I Understand it more. I will try and relay that to you guys like I am still in the dark about it to be honest I'm still trying to wrap my head around it as well It is definitely very technical, but you know, it's also very very new. It's it's basically only a few weeks old at this point So yeah, we're just gonna have to let it simmer let it kind of like digest a bit and we'll get there We'll get there. I'm sure we'll all be able to kind of like understand it sooner rather than later And this is a good step this this seminar here So I'm definitely going to be probably asleep when this happens So I'll be re watching it or at least watching the recording once that's done And one other thing about I guess like core core development was this merge community call that happened So this is the third merge community call that happened You can see the agenda here of what was spoken about and there's a recording available as well on the Ethereum cat herders YouTube channel which is linked in the GitHub are kind of like issue here and I'll link this in the YouTube description Yes, as I said, this is this was the third community call about the merge These the goal of these things is to obviously keep the community updated with what's happening on the merge with merge, especially the community I guess that is part of running infrastructure doing kind of like anything like developing and things like that because the merge impacts not just I guess like obviously, you know end users in terms of kind of the the fact that like the network will be proof of staying Instead of proof of work, but it you know, it impacts like a wide set of stakeholders I would actually argue the end users who are just using the network are least impacted by this Um developers are impacted by it in some ways like for example the block time being 12 seconds I'm flat like it's it's always going to be 12 seconds. Whereas with the work. It's it's um, it's kind of like probabilistic So it there's like a target block time, but it's on average about 13.2 seconds But it can vary whereas with reverse take it's always going to be 12 seconds And you know, there's a few other kind of like either synchrony See idiosyncrasy things there. I mean, yeah, one of them that block time thing was mentioned here in the agenda But yeah, anyway, go watch the recording. I haven't watched it yet a plan too soon But these community calls are always a very good and gives you more context around the merge Alright, so client diversity This is a topic that I have been speaking about a lot on the refuel lately and this has got to do with client diversity On the consensus layer aka the beacon chain not so much the execution layer Which is I guess like what we all enjoy with a theorem today now There's a new website called pools dot in visa cloud here, which basically tracks The I guess like validator counts and usage type of a popular staking service providers So you can see here that there's an overall kind of like statistics that's saying the estimated validated count is 274 thousand six hundred twenty eight with an estimated prism usage of sixty six point nine percent now Obviously that's too high that's over the two-thirds threshold, which is pretty much in critical territory there This is definitely not what we want to see And you know, I've discussed kind of like why this is a bad thing before There's also an in-depth discussion on this website as well like written down here that you can go You can go give a read and there's a bunch of links to different kind of resources as well So definitely check that out. I'm not gonna rehash it here because I've talked about it too much lately I think um, but yeah, you can see who the biggest offenders are here now Obviously coinbase has a very large presence on the beacon chain They have almost 50,000 validators, which is almost 1 5th of the network Which which obviously is about 20% there So it's it's quite a large stake in the beacon chain and you can see actually is 24 24 point 2 3 percent exactly Now their prison usage is at 92% Now let me put this into context for you guys if the worst case scenario was to happen Like I told like like I've said to you guys before is basically two-thirds of the chain, which is you know prism finalizing on kind of like fun, sorry finalizing on a bug kind of like A client because it was a bug in prison or something like that You know and then it kind of reverts later the prism uses stand to lose a lot here, right? Now it's funny because like would the humidity go with the minority chain in this case instead of the majority even if it was the Prism clients fault of the bug the social consensus around this gets very murky But you know if if they did coinbase would stand to lose a lot here and this isn't their eat This is their users eat. So they're at very high risk By using so many so many kind of like prism clients here and they definitely need to change and I just think that they're not aware of how how much risk they're taking on by doing this I think because You know if you improve stake is very unique with its client diversity and with having multiple clients whereas pretty much All other proof of stake implementations aren't multi client friendly I think coinbase kind of like just defaulted to being like okay Well, we know what prism is we're just going to use prism and to get them to change because there's such a large Organization is going to be difficult which I mean I get that and then you know the same is true for crack in here Which has about fifteen point six percent of the overall Validators they're also at you know 94 percent of prism usage so more than coinbase at 92 percent and you can scroll down and list here Lido is a lot better. They've only got 42 percent Prism usage and they account for 11 percent of network Binance is a bit better than crackin and coinbase at 76 percent with a 10 percent usage and you know you can just scroll down the list here, but you can see you know this red bar that Pretty much most of these providers are just way overweight on on prism here And they've just kind of like completely ignored using other I guess clients and I spoke about rocker pool the other day How they're doing really well in the client diversity department, but unfortunately they're not a big part of the network yet, right? They're only 0.1 percent because they only launched recently But their prism uses that are only about 10 percent which is which is awesome to see right like I highlighted this the other day It doesn't matter how small they are it's very awesome to see that and there's a bunch of other You know much smaller operators here, but on you know net them for the most part obviously because we have this kind of like overall percentage Here the prism usage is too high now the whole point of this website these resources. You know these kind of like Educational drives and me bringing this up all the time is that we're trying to get that prism usage Down as much as we can and every effort that we do matters. I believe you know I've spoken about how in the background I'm aware of a few people reaching out to these providers You know in filling them in on these risks getting them to kind of like Change from prism to another client or at least all the kind of like validator that they spin up going forward aren't prison validators And there's been some progress there, but obviously these organizations being very large they have processes They have to go through they move very slow and you have to basically Convince them like why this is a bad thing or why they stand to lose money? Because you know if you don't do that then they're just not going to care so there's a lot of that going on in the background I think you know I remain optimistic that we can get the prism usage down to at least on the 60% That's you know that's what 6.9% from here I remain optimistic that we can get to that But it's going to be like realistically a very very heavy lift to get prism under 50% right Let alone to what we'd love prism to be out or at least any client to be out which is under 30% Now is it impossible? No, it's just you got to look at what's practical What's you know what fits in with reality and where to focus your efforts? So I think right now the efforts are just focused on getting prism as low as we possibly can right even if that's only to 60% in you know in the next six months or something like that then that's that's fine Maybe in 12 months when we you know I but travels or so months When we have um withdrawals enabled on the beacon chain maybe people will feel a lot more comfortable changing clients because right now people don't want to take the risk because you can't re-enter staking if you if something happens like if you accidentally exit yourself from from sorry if you want to exit yourself from the Validator set you can you can exit but you can't you know you you can't withdraw that eight you can't restate you can't Activate your validator again whereas when withdraw was unable you can do this so a lot of people want to do this Whereas when withdraw was unable you can do this so a lot of people what they want to do is they want to exit Then change clients and then re-enter with that kind of like a new client Because they don't want to run the risk of getting slashed or losing any eave and I totally understand that So maybe we see the needle really move on this once withdrawals are enabled on the beacon chain But I'm hoping that we can get to at least 60% or less on Prism usage here Before that happens, and it really depends you know the funny thing is if coinbase and Kraken Just kind of like Reduce their prism usage by 10 15 percent or something like that I think it should actually get us down to you know pretty close to haven't run the numbers here But they've got such a large presence on the chain that anything that they do even if it's five ten percent less prism usage is Going to have a massive impact on the network and you know this brings up another kind of discussion around Centralization of steak I mean I didn't realize coinbase was so high twenty four percent is pretty high let's be honest, right? That's an almost ten percent higher than the next highest which is Kraken which has fifteen percent which is which is too high as well But I've written about this in the newsletter before where I basically argued that I don't think Centralized exchanges having a large stake is necessarily a Existential risk or like a really bad thing I think they have a bunch of incentives not to kind of screw with the chain of Course you know if coinbase was to purposely try and attack the ethereum chain Not only would they most likely get slashed and lose their customers eith they would suffer some an Incredible amount of kind of like bad press and their business would directly suffer because of this their stock price would tank You know because they're a public company now. There's not many you know they have to be very very careful, so Obviously we shouldn't rely on altruism, but there are a lot of kind of like crypto economic incentives in place both at the Protocol layer and both at the inner and social layer because I think that the social layer I was obviously plays a big part here and is incredibly important and anyone who says that the social layer or humans don't have any Saying this is wrong Humans are the last line of defense the layer zero is humans They're the last line of defense against any kind of attack, so you know even though they have a large stake is large stake Yeah, I think that it's relatively, okay now Is it okay in the face of face of nation nation states if a nation state ordered coinbase to? Attack the ethereum network or just you know coinbase Kraken and both being us based I mean even like a Few other here a u.s.. Base if they were if they kind of like order them to do that would that would that happen? I mean probably like an attack would go through but again The social area of ethereum is global the the net the protocol itself has ways to kind of punish bad actors And this attack would fail they could only attack once it's not like on proof of work where? You can keep attacking because your ass six you know keep existing with with proof of stake on ethereum The attackers get slashed there there all their validators get ejected and you know most of their stake is gone So they can't repeat the same attack again So that's a really nice property of a theorems proof of stake But it shouldn't ever get to that it shouldn't ever get to a point where we need the social layer And that's why there's always kind of like protections in place, and that's a big reason why let's get prism down below You know sixty percent. Let's make sure that No, our client has such a huge market share because there are five really really awesome Beak it and chain or consensus layer clients that you can use there's no reason No reason in particular to use prism over another client and not to say that prism is a bad client But it's not like the prism client is like ten times better than the next client. No there are Small improvements that can be made over time there are small efficiencies There are there are small differences between the clients in terms of kind of like performance But they're pretty much all like for like in terms of in terms of performance and really unless you're trying to get the absolute maximum amount of reward that you can add about staking with your validator, and I'm talking like The tiniest differences like a 1% difference sort of thing unless you're going for that There's no reason to pick the majority client at this stage show if you're spinning up a new validator You go for something other than prism right now I mean I every time I spin up a new validator I go for something other than prism straightaway like it doesn't matter which other client It is just as long as it's not prism even though I started with prison by the way like I was I started with prison Because there was such a such a big name everyone knew about them that was so trusted And that's why we're in the position We're at now because it's just you know it can be very hard to keep track of four or five clients I understand that and kind of like people's bandwidth in this space is very low So you know you just hear prism or a lot of the guides are focused around prism and lighthouse Especially not so much the other clients And you know prism got to this state because of that now we can reverse this It's not like this is how it has to be forever We can reverse this and that's what all the efforts going on are going to do so I recommend checking out this website it gives you a lot more information about this than I just did and Encourage your staking service provider encourage the exchange you're staking with you for staking with them encourage anyone You know to get off prism for now and to use one of the other clients and not as I said not because prism is Bad the client but because them having sixty six point nine percent of the network is bad for the network for Every participant of the beacon chain so yeah definitely go do that That's kind of like my only ask of you from from here, but I'll link this in the description You can go check it out for yourself All right, so David Mihal has updated his L2 fees info website with a really really cool a bunch of metrics here Which basically shows that the amount of I guess like dollars that each of these L2 is paying a theorem L1 for its security So you can see here the one day security costs of different L2s Albatrum is currently paying $53,000 a day to secure itself on a theorem L1 And I guess like this links to more details on L2 beat as well if you click through here Which is really cool, then you can see dydx paying about 30k optimism 25k And then you have a long tail here of others and how much they're paying each day now obviously These security costs are going to go up or down based on layer 1 gas fees. This is dollar terms This is not in eith terms So if the gas fees are high I mean right now. They're actually quite low They're hanging around 30 to 40 quay Which is what three times lower than they were a couple months ago, so this would be three times larger And it's also influenced by how much the L2 is being used as well right how much you know how often these um? These proofs and these core data is core data is being posted to L1 But you can see you know this may be negligible right now like I don't even think I mean, I think the top three out up to about 100k And then the other ones maybe 120 130 K a day right now And if you actually go to L2 fees dot info if I click through here Sorry, not L2 fees and if I crypto fees that info you can see a theorems one day fees are 16.6 million dollars now right now, which is actually on the low side I mean well It's gotten quiet out there guys like not just on chain But just everywhere the crypto ecosystem seems quote unquote dead right now Which I mean makes sense because the markets have been quote unquote dead and I think it's going to last for Long I do think that we're going to we're going to keep going here, but just funny how like how Volatile not just the crypto markets are but kind of like the crypto system is in general But anyway back to what I was saying so 16.6 million dollars on layer one right now We are on a theorem layer one in terms of fees being paid and on L2 fees I guess the total sorry the um the total of the L2 is a paying to L1 to secure themselves is about 111,000 so that is a very small part of the total fees being paid on a theorem L1, but that's okay I said to you guys it would start off slow and small with L2s And then it would ramp up over time and over the long term talking a few years at this point Most of the L1 transaction fees will be replaced with L2 securing themselves, but right now L1 has what? 70 80 last time I checked 90 billion dollars locked in in DeFi billions of dollars of DEX DEX volume happens every day and that leads to a lot of MEV leads to a lot of arbitrage Which is which is a form of MEV and as I explained to you guys before the people doing MEV are happy to pay Whatever in fees as long as they can inch out a bit of a profit and obviously a lot of people still do stuff on L1 as well so until we get like more adoption at L2 until we get more and more people migrating there until we get a Lot more I guess like MEV at L2 or at least the MEV opportunities at L2 Which there really isn't any right now because they've got centralized sequences I think L1 will still be you know still be kind of like the majority Sorry L1 native transactions will still be the majority of the fees being paid which is totally fine I mean at the end of the day It's still being burned no matter what but I think it's gonna take like a few years for L2s to take over But they will take over eventually and you know just like it took a few years to get to the L1 fees that they are Today I mean it took more than a few years it took from mid 2015 when ETH launched to I guess like the high fee Started persisting around mid 2020 so it took like five years Probably not gonna take five years for the L2s to really ramp up and be you know be responsible for millions of dollars a day In transaction fees on L1, but it's gonna take a little bit of time here. It's not gonna happen overnight It's definitely gonna take the market heating up again because that's when all the activity heats up and things like that But yeah still cool to see this website. I'm gonna keep track of it I want to see one of these L2s break the 1 million dollar one day security costs one day. That'd be really cool I'm I'm sure it'll happen on a volatile day when we have like you know retail froth and mania back in But for now we're just plotting along. You know while we wait for that to happen again Alright so Pratik here put together a really great thread on Starkware So this is a mega thread you can go and check this out a link to the YouTube description But there is so much happening in the Starkware slash Starknet ecosystem right now. It's actually quite crazy There's also a newsletter that I've highlighted before from swag. Namis prime It has a weekly newsletter on on the stock net ecosystem, and I'm actually subscribed to that and wow There's a lot happening on there. You may not hear about it too much on Twitter But there's so much happening in the background there are so many people building on there And it's actually just really amazing to see how quickly adoption is happening there because as I've said to you guys before I Want to see Stark net succeed for lots of reasons obviously But the number one reason is because it can prove out the non Evm l2 thesis because Evm l2s are cool. I love them like they work really well. They're obviously in super high demand But like we shouldn't just stop there We have this amazing technology with layer twos with optimistic roll-ups with zk roll-ups and all that and everything in between Let's take advantage of it, and that's exactly what stock net is doing. They're basically saying well No, we don't have to use the Evm. We don't have to use solidity we can use our own language called Cairo We can use our own our own kind of computing System we start net and we can create a non Evm and generalized platform using zk roll-ups Which is which is obviously awesome not to say that the Evm generalize platforms aren't equally as awesome But I you know particularly like to see adoption of this stuff happening because the Evm stuff We already know is going to get adoption There's no doubt there with the Evm stuff I mean the Evm is the biggest kind of like thing in crypto right now all the out ones are using it all the sidechains Everything is using it so we don't have to say oh is this going to get adoption it is But we do want to kind of like see if the non Evm chains Whether they be L2 or L1 do get adoption and it seems that they will It's just going to obviously take longer, but we will get there But if you want to learn more about all of that check out this thread from petite. It was a really great one I really enjoyed reading it and checking out all the resources. I'll link it in the YouTube description for you to do so All right, so faina here had a really great thread on everything happening in Ethereum L2 generally so not just stock net But like everything happening on all the L2s that we all know and love you know optimism, Arbatrum, the Polygon, ZK, Sync, Starkware, Mutable There's so many right right now. Which is pretty crazy But in this thread is a there's a bunch of links to things that have happened I guess in the last week or so week and a half or so You know covering all the kind of like L2s that I just mentioned So if you want to dive even deeper into the L2 stuff get more involved with it definitely check out this thread after you've checked Out protig's thread this will keep you busy guys for a while I mean, it's funny like I sometimes I'm like to myself okay like what am I going to do today? Like I wake up, and I go to my computer I've finished checking Twitter on like what am I going to do today? Then I look at my chrome tabs and holy shit guys there's like hundreds of chrome ties because what I end up doing is I Dive into these things I open up. What's interest me and say okay? I'm going to add this to the read later list like once I'm done what I need to do today I'll read that later and obviously builds up over time because you never get to it I try to get to it on weekends when I have a little bit more time, but it doesn't happen But all this stuff happens and I actually have a very very short attention span Like extremely short it kind of like sucks a lot of the time because I'll be reading something there like oh Shiny, and I'll go over there, but it what you know I mean it works for me I guess like to some extent but don't feel bad The point of what I'm saying is I don't feel bad if you have like all these tabs up And you haven't gotten to them yet Just keep them there because like eventually you'll get to them like eventually I do get to them And I actually got to a point where I closed most of them. You know I read through them. I was like okay That's cool. That's cool. I'll say that for later blah blah And you know I'll go back to that later And then I caught you know and some of them I actually just killed because I'm like yeah, I'm never going to read this because they were really long I'm like nah, I don't need I don't need to read this and I need a tldr And sometimes it's a tldr which which which helps a lot, but yeah Don't feel bad if you don't get to everything like today or tomorrow like there's going to be you know sometimes the tabs sit in My in chrome for months for me, and then I go back and I read it And I'm like oh is this even still relevant anymore, and the thing is a lot of it still is Especially the L2 stuff because the L2 ecosystem is moving really quickly But there's a lot of fundamental knowledge there that is being built on Slowly in the background and learning about this and kind of like taking it all in is really really positive So yeah, as I said don't feel bad about it I'll link this in the youtube description for you to check out And just kind of like do it when you have time don't force yourself. Don't try to be don't get anxious about it Don't be like oh my God. I need to do this. I need to do this now You know just take it easy let it kind of like sit in because if you rush through it You're not even going to absorb the knowledge So just let it sit in let you know take it all in do it one at a time and don't try to like overwhelm Yourself because that never works Alright, so etherscan put out an update over the weekend that they've got like a long overdue addition to the gas tracker Which now estimates the cost of transaction action, so you'll have seen this on other gas trackers out there before But you can see here that etherscan shows you low average and high gas prices for various actions on a theorem such as an open sea sale a uni sub v3 swap and A usdt transfer, so there's a few other screenshots here NOSA safe multi-sigs Arbitrum deposits, which is really cool knowing how much is going to cost you to deposit to L2 Which is quite cheap right now at about at 40 grades. It's less than $10 So if you're thinking about depositing into L2 now would be the best time to do it probably I mean I don't see gas prices getting much lower than this maybe we go into the 20s again Maybe if the market really gets quiet and like literally nothing is happening Maybe we go to the single digits again, but I'm not counting on it So now it's probably the best time to do that But yeah, I love these kind of things because you know sending eighth on on On on a theorem is the cheapest thing you can do But like it's the most boring thing you can do and most of the actions on the theorem Network aren't really kind of like sending Eighth around most of them are smart contract interaction So knowing the cost of popular smart contract interactions is much better than knowing the cost of just a simple eith transfer So yeah, I love these kind of kinds of tools and that's just available in the ethereum gas tracker section of the ether scan website Which you can go check out for yourself Right an update out of element finance over the weekend. They introduced something called a voting vaults Which is a new governance primitive from the council protocol So what you can do with voting vaults is stake governance tokens in compound are there uni swap? Our ones and L twos and still participate in governance and they're calling these governance Lego pieces now this is really cool because I've spoken about this before about how There needs to be a way for people to be able to use their assets But also participate in governance without having to withdraw those assets So for example if you put up your assets collateral and RV and you're borrowing against it and then you want to use those assets In governance a lot of the time you can't because they're in are there right you can't sign That you have them because you've deposited them into the are they smart contract and they're technically no longer in you know I mean they are yours because you have the IOU for it, but they're in the smart contract They're not in your own wallet. So the with voting vaults you can now do both You can have your assets in are there or ever? Well, whatever support whatever protocol is supported and still participate in the governance for these various things here Which should lead to better kind of like governance participation, you know Less voter apathy all those sorts of things there But yeah I just think this is a really cool primitive and something that I've wanted to see for a very long time now Because obviously voter apathy is wrought within crypto like it's it's pretty If I had to pick one bear case for for governance It would be the voter apathy and I'm only just talking about crypto governance I talk about I'm talking about in general like in Australia We actually have a law that you have to vote like by law you have to vote or you get fined for it I know in the US no such thing exists. It's it's not a law to vote. You can just like not vote at all And I know strike people that don't want to actually vote do what's called a donkey vote which I mean I think I think it originated from people literally drawing donkeys on their ballot and putting it into the Not on their on their piece of paper and putting it into the ballot box But like the ditch it refers to like not actually, you know, we have ranked choice voting in Australia But it refers to not actually filling out the form at all with any of the numbers and just drawing something on it Sometimes people will drop, you know, the the stupidest things on it But that's what it is like you register when you go there to say, okay, you voted and doesn't matter after that now That that leads to a high voter turnout obviously and there's a culture of like high voter turnout and But then in other places the voter turnout can be low I mean, you know and you if you're living in a democracy like that It kind of like defeats the purpose right like you want to have high voter turnout. You want everyone's voice to be heard Whereas we think crypto protocols with governance. It's it's much much worse because most people aren't holding these tokens to participate in governance They're holding the tokens to speculate on and obviously, you know in in governance systems in real life There's no kind of like token that you hold technically the token that you hold is like an NFT Which is your citizenship or we you know If you're a citizen of a country, then you can vote in the elections or even a resident in some countries, I believe But that's kind of like your NFT to vote. It's not like you have to go buy some some shares or some tokens or something You don't have to buy enough to buy shares in the government that you you know The other country that you're in to be able to vote whereas it's very very different within kind of like DeFi Yes, like in dows in general is where you can't actually vote unless you have the governance token now, you know Am I bearish on that long term? I don't have I'm undecided am I bearish on it right now? Yes, because of the fact that there's so much voter apathy like I could talk about this for a long time this plutocracy There's voter apathy There's literally like it's it's so bad like 90 plus easily percent of the tokens just do not ever participate in governance which means you have basically a Dictatorship of just like a few small parties and they could just be whales that hold a lot of tokens Influencing the whole protocol so anything we can do to kind of like remedy that or at least help that a little bit Which you know these voting voting vaults is one way of doing it is good in my books But I'm still undecided if like I'm bearish on governance the way we're doing it right now Long term I would actually like to see like NFTs be used more within governance where you if you're kind of like If you're kind of like done something for a protocol if you're participating in a protocol Maybe you've actually got funds in our there, but you don't hold any other tokens Well, maybe you should be able to participate in governance as well. Like you still have skin in the game You still kind of like want you know other to be I guess like a protocol that functions correctly that that got that is governed Correctly, but maybe you just don't want to hold the token. There's plenty of people who do that, right? I mean I do it with maker I have my funds in make I don't own any MK our token So I guess like from that perspective, I'd like to see more experimentation here But voting vaults is also a good step there. But anyway, I think that's it for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel If you haven't yet get the video thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the discord channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow Thanks, everyone

 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily gray refuel where we cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host Anthony sasano and today's the 20th of December 2021 Alright everyone. Let's get into it. So a new space new room. I'm all set up in my new office Well, I shouldn't say all set up There's still plenty left to do but as you can see I have a much more space now than I did This is kind of like more than double. I think the space of the previous room that I had It's just amazing having so much room for activities So just been really kind of like hard at work over the last three to four days kind of just moving in You know, there's still plenty of stuff left to unbox and everything like I'd never moved before so I didn't realize just how much work Was involved in it. It's been a crazy I guess last month right packing everything and then moving in and now kind of like Unpacking it all so you'll see this room of all over time the with things added maybe things changed I just kind of like sets set some stuff up just to get it out there get it out of the garage out of the Boxes into the room here. But yeah, I've been I've been quiet obviously over the last few days I haven't really been in the discord very much I've been pretty quiet on Twitter But I have tried my best to keep up with everything that's happened and a lot has happened over the last few days It's pretty crazy, you know and the price just seems to be kind of like doing nothing really I mean, I haven't even been checking the price that much but I saw it the other day went like 4k now It's back to like 3780 or something like that. Haven't really been monitoring it too much But but yeah, I mean it seems to just kind of be waddling around I guess it's Christmas time right? Everyone's kind of like spending time with friends and family people just you know traveling doing stuff There's not really much kind of like action going on in the markets But there's definitely a lot of action going on on the fundamental side of things So without further ado there, I'm gonna jump into the news from last three days So this will be kind of like Friday Saturday and Sunday. So let's go. So polygon has a few updates I'm gonna go through first one. Is that Alexis Ohanian the co-founder of reddit? I'm probably gonna have teamed up to invest two hundred million dollars in decentralized social media, which is really really cool here So, you know, I remember now there was kind of an announcement out of the Solana conference I think couple months ago that Alexis was going to build something on Solana with got to do with decentralized social media I think that's still going ahead but great to see him not kind of like just sticking to one ecosystem He's actually kind of playing with all of them or it seems to be wanting to play with all of them Which makes a lot of sense, right? It doesn't make sense for him just to stick to kind of like one ecosystem mean most people aren't gonna be Quote-unquote maximalist, they're not gonna be kind of like married to any one ecosystem It's good to kind of experiment see what you know What what each one's all about and kind of like come to the conclusion about which one you want to spend the most amount of? Time on so that's really cool to see but yeah, it's a huge kind of like win here for for polygon I mean you guys know I'm an advisor to polygon always really great to see this kind of stuff and especially seeing these kind of Like numbers like 200 million dollars nothing to scoff at guys like for decentralized social media Which is still considered a niche within crypto. I would say it's not something that I Guess like is something that every investor out there is just scrambling to get in on I think you know at the moment obviously The investment markets pretty hot like in both the private and public markets because of all the money printing Or in part because of the money printing but also because there's so many kind of like ideas out there that people don't want to miss Out on investing on in them, but it's almost something like DeFi or NFTs Or kind of like crypto gaming where you know everyone's scrambling to get into these things The centralized social media is kind of this thing that everyone is kind of like thinking okay? Well, what's this gonna look like how is it actually gonna play out like are we actually going to get something? That's usable and that isn't just going to be gained by bots What of experimentation happening but great to see that another 200 million dollars. We're going into that kind of like use case there All right next up from polygon. Is that the Uniswap v3 will be deployed on polygon very soon They said in a few days two days ago or one day ago, so I'm assuming it's gonna happen this week You know I've been kind of like keeping up with this for you guys being kind of monitoring over the last few days Really really awesome to see that the Uniswap community will has voted to deploy v3 on polygons POS chain By a pretty large margin here you can see 72 million votes for five hundred and three thousand against sorry I mean there's really no competition. That's basically a 99% or 98% yes right there So I'm looking forward to seeing Uniswap on polygon It's funny because Uniswap's only on Arbitrum and Optimism right now And then when they'll go to polygon and they'll have three deployments as well as a theory main that obviously so if you count that It's four and I'm curious to see where they go next do they deploy to Stark net probably not because of the fact that Stark net is an EVM compatible. It's very new. It's still in developer only mode There isn't really kind of demand for it yet, but do they deploy to something like zk sync I mean zk sync did a demo of Uniswap or an amm I guess you can you could say a fork of Uniswap running on their technology So I wouldn't be surprised to to see that play out either But yeah really really cool to see a Uniswap finally being deployed to the polygon POS chain Next up speaking of Polygons POS chain you can now look at the now explore the POS bridge explorer So you can see here that they've announced What's something called the POS bridge explorer which allows you to kind of like see transactions going? To and from that bridge you guys know I've talked a lot about bridges before on the refuel and how how Kind of like we need more insight into them especially for user safety and things like that So it's great to see polygon bringing out a tool that allows people to kind of like play around with this sort of stuff So this will be linked in the YouTube description for you to check out Next up from polygon a lot of updates from them today So they have moved nightfall to the Ropsten test net on the ethereum network So polygon nightfall for those of you don't know is a hybrid zk Optimistic roll-up for privacy this was developed by ey and then kind of like merged with polygon and it's now on the polygon Polygon's kind of wing here. So great to see them go live on tip on test net on the Ropsten test net here I mean main that shouldn't be far away and they've aiming to provide low-cost private ethereum transactions Sort of like Aztec that I spoke about last week, which I'm going to speak about against the day actually But yeah good to have more competition in the privacy space I mean I've spoken about privacy plenty of times and I think it's like One of two critical building blocks for this stuff to scale to the world The first is obviously scaling technologies right like roll-ups and all that but the second is privacy I think they go hand in hand very well because as you've seen, you know Polygon nightfall is a scalable privacy privacy tech like it's a layer to a private layer to same with Aztec So I'm with a few other kind of ones out there So we're kind of getting the holy grail when it comes to scaling and privacy in one So I'm really really excited about that Alright moving on from polygon to optimism. So optimism released there or removed I should say their white list last week as I predicted I think I said on one of last week's refills that I would expect it to happen last week So yeah, the white list has has been gone actually for the last three or four days now So anyone can now deploy to optimism or optimistic aetherium, which is really really cool Obviously now this puts them basically on equal footing with arbitrum in terms of what developers can do I know that they're kind of like differ because optimism has the OVM which is a VM equivalent Arbitrum has the AVM which is it which is like mostly a VM compatible. Look. I'm not a developer I haven't deployed to any of these networks. I don't know which approach is better I don't know if developers have actually run into any issues on either network So, you know be cool to kind of like speak to a developer about this if you are one definitely kind of like chime in In the discord channel that that's kind of played around with this But yeah, I haven't heard anything and it seems like projects can now just deploy to optimism and arbitrum simultaneously Right, like you the funny thing is you don't even have to deploy to main now You can just deploy to optimism and arbitrum and and you know and and go on your way You know, I've noticed some projects have picked specific ecosystems. Like for example, Lyra has picked Optimism, I don't they haven't deployed to arbitrum. Maybe they weren't deployed arbitra I'm sorry, maybe they will in the future, but I'm not sure and then you have premiere which is on arbitrum not on optimism I'm sure that they all have plans to deploy to other kind of like EVM compatible networks eventually but it's it's kind of like funny to think about because Whatever they pick first is going to be where they build a lot of the network effect where they build a lot of the community And are we gonna see kind of like layer 2 maximalism not only in when these laters have tokens But also for the projects on these layer 2 so people be like, ah, you know this project deployed to this other layer 2 and this other layer 2 well, I don't like this project anymore I don't think so because that hasn't really happened with the ether mainnet projects that have deployed to other chains You know, for example obvious deployed to other chains like avalanche And a few other projects out there and the community hasn't shunned them for it or anything like that. Like it's fine I mean, it makes sense from a business perspective It's very very easy to do and if there's demand there then the it's actually kind of like the projects responsibility to deploy them Because if they don't they're kind of like leaving money on the table at the end of the day, right? So yeah, cool to see our optimism's white list finally gone and another related update to this optimism has kind of like leaned in to Their kind of like name being optimism instead of optimistic aetherium. So they're basically just Going just gonna be referred to as optimism from now on So, you know, I know I've kind of like tried to separate it before where I've said there's the optimistic aetherium network then there's optimism that's kind of like building the The kind of network but it's really optimism PBC public goods public Public goods corporation. I know I can't remember the base stands for but it's probably basically like a public public goods funding I know how they kind of like donated all of their revenue All of their sorry profits from their sequencer to public goods and then it's just optimism It just describes kind of like the optimism ecosystem, which I think is makes a lot of sense and I think Previously it was a bit kind of like tongue-tied for people because even with arbitrum right for example Like arbitrum is built by off-chain labs and arbitrum isn't isn't the name of the network It's arbitrum one right because there's gonna be a bit from reddit and then I'll be trim something else and not from something else Whereas I think with with optimism it'll be kind of like a similar thing But it may be kind of like renames because optimism has already been forced to Forked a few times like Nami and metis. I'm pretty sure they both modified folks of optimism Whereas I'll do the term optimism we use to just describe the optimum optimism ecosystem I've said that word so many times now I'm gonna stop but yeah cool to see them leaning into this naming here So speaking of arbitrum, they put out a blog post over the weekend called optimistic roll-ups at the present and future of a theorem scaling I can't load any of these links. Sorry guys. My internet seems to have cut out here But anyway, you can find these links in the YouTube description You'll be able to check them out. But this speaks to what I was kind of like speaking about I don't know if it was last week or the week before about how I believe that Optimistic roll-ups are not a short to medium term solution I've said this before that I think that if everything goes well with zk roll-ups There may be optimistic roll-ups are a short to medium term only solution, but honestly over the last few weeks I've come more around to the fact that Even if zk roll-ups do everything that we dream that they will do they've still drawbacks There's still trade-offs and there's still room for optimistic roll-ups to kind of like, you know thrive So that's why for me personally I'm not a bit like I'm trying really hard not to get stuck into these kind of like L2 maximalism which I see a few people kind of doing like I've seen comments from people before saying that You know polygon has all these teams and so every other kind of like L2 team is worthless and like that's so toxic Like that's not how we are in the community. That's something I would expect from like the Bitcoin maximalist I would not expect that from people in the Ethereum community. Yes. The polygon ecosystem is awesome. They have a lot of layer two teams But that doesn't take away from the work that arbitrum and optimism are doing or zk sync are doing or stark We're doing they're all doing amazing work and they all kind of like benefit each other right? It is a symbiotic relationship They're they're kind of like benefiting each other both in the research and development side of things So yeah, I'm really glad I've been put this blog post out. It's a banger as well. I enjoyed reading it So I'll link this in the YouTube description. You can go check it out All right Next up in staying on the theme of layer twos Consensus has announced that they're launching consensus roll-ups in partnership with MasterCard to provide enterprise grade scalability Plus address the key challenge of scalable applications on the consensus quorum tech stack. This is pretty big, you know It's funny whenever you hear these enterprise announcements you always think to yourself. Okay, it's big but like what can I do with it today? Like does it does it even matter to me? Does it matter to me as an end-user and most of the time or pretty much all the time? No, it doesn't because these things are not for you, right? They're kind of like for the back end of these enterprise systems and they're going to be closed they're gonna be permissioned and if they're kind of like these intranets or kind of internal networks that these enterprises use in order to kind of stay on the bleeding edge and kind of like be able to talk to these public networks because I think MasterCard visa a few of the other ones out there. They're kind of like blockchain innovation hubs They're kind of like pushing the message that blockchains are going to replace all of finance essentially like a theorem is is you know I mean has a very high chance of becoming the new kind of like global sediment layer for all financial Transactions to settle on so how do we position ourselves for that? That's what they're asking themselves and this is how they do that. They get involved with the bleeding bleeding edge tech They build their own solutions in-house, which is fine And then they can kind of like open source it later if they want I mean quorum was was built in-house by JP Morgan and then consensus I guess kind of like acquired it or kind of like took it under its wing I was talking before about polygon nightfall, which was built in-house by ey and You know then polygon took it under its wing so there's plenty of these things that have been developed in kind of the enterprise setting and then kind of either get open sourced or Or kind of like the the team is basically absorbed. I mean you look at what happened with polygon Midan Sorry, not might enough polygon zero. No. No was might and might and sorry That was the stock based roll-up that they're doing the guy That's leading that was actually working at kind of like Facebook and kind of like doing stock stuff at Facebook So it's all additive guys like just because you don't Kind of like see the enterprise stuff very often or it's not something that you can tangibly use it all adds to everything else like the open source is beautiful like that because Everyone can just kind of like look at everyone else's work Study it, you know, yes, there's copycats and things like that But that the spirit of open source is to study it improve it kind of like come together as a collective and make a you know Great pieces of software. So from that perspective I'm really glad to see enterprises getting more involved in the in the roll-up space here Alright, so Aztec Network has announced a 17 million dollar series a round led by paradigm and now I spoke about Aztec last week, of course with their launch of They're kind of like ZK roller as you kzk kind of roll up there where you could do Sorry, I stick connect I should say on their kind of like ZK right where you could do private transactions from layer 2 on layer 1 Which is really really cool. I do have to disclose I participated in this round of Aztec here I absolutely love what they're building I mean privacy as I said before is one of the two main pillars that we need to scale to global adoption So I was more than happy to support them in their kind of mission to do that here and they've been around for quite a while Aztec like I remember I've talked I've talked about them for a long time now and they really are I think the first Zkzk roll up in production the Aztec connect is a mind-blowing I mean being able to do private transactions at layer 2 and have them relayed at layer 1 and still be fully private So you can get to tap into layer 1 liquidity that stuff's mind-blowing guys Like I've spoken about this before about kind of um, like bridging and arbitrary message relaying and stuff like that But this takes to the next level where you're kind of like, okay, let's talk to layer 1, but let's keep it private, right? Let's have a roll up that's designed to do private transactions, but also tap into layer 1 ether Now it's not going to just be limited to layer 1 ether and by the way They're going to be able to connect to all the other L twos as well and do the same thing So this is crazy. But yeah, this this rounds pretty cool Seventeen million dollars they've led by paradigm Of course with participation from a bunch of other funds like variant nascent some of the other ones you may have heard of scale a capital Here and then a bunch of angels including myself the bankless guys Vitalik mariano Conti a few others here as well But yeah, if you want to kind of like learn more about what Aztec is doing What this fund raise means and everything like that this link to this thread will be it will be in the YouTube description below All right speaking of Aztec actually second update here Element finance announced that L2 scaling is coming to element through Aztec So lower gas costs have been one of the most awaited features by the element community Of course, and they've chosen Aztec as their first exploration into L2 scaling solutions. This is interesting because I'm pretty sure Element is the first project to choose Aztec as their scaling provider instead of an arbitrary on optimism So that's really cool to say right and as I said guys There's no point being an L2 maximalist because all these L2s are going to have like these apps kind of like deployed them first But then over time they're gonna deploy everywhere. Like I don't think element is just gonna stick on Aztec They're obviously going to deploy to other L2s as well but they have to pick one to start with and it's cool to see that as they's getting some love from from element here and Kind of like elements picking them instead of one of the other ones because that's how these networks kind of like Grow and thrive they really need to be able to get Kind of like these projects onto their networks in order to build Some liquidity and user a user base and all that sort of stuff there. So really really cool to see this So basically what this integration means is that element transactions with Aztec we batched into roll-ups that will be scheduled to run based on The relative demand per asset this means that as the main grows batches will run more frequently and become larger Resulting in cheaper gas cost per transaction obviously how roll-ups work after careful analysis Element came to the conclusion that the integration with Aztec network would bring gas savings ranging from six times to 40 times on average Depending on the specific term and asset huge got huge savings, right? Especially with something like element which is trying to Do fixed rate yields and sorry fixed and variable yield markets, which is obviously a very big market. So really really cool to see this All right. Last thing here is a comment from Louie who's from all Lewis from stock where he ecosystem lead at stock where he was In a thread with Polina kryptomax II for other people here, but basically Lewis said we are 100% focused on a theorem We have enough features and projects for at least over two years I had to tell other layer one projects that regardless of the amount of money thrown at us We won't be able to deploy there. So I've been critical of stock where in the past I've been critical of who they took money from in terms of their fundraisers. Remember three hours capital and Alameda I'm still critical of that but stock waste tech is amazing. They're an amazing team. They care deeply about scaling block chains and With this comment here. They seem to still be 100% focused on a theorem even though people I guess like Eli have basically Hinted it. Otherwise, like you can see here Lewis says Eli is a stark maximalist and believe that all chains will adopt stock at some Point using stock waste tech or others. This might be the reason some got the perception that we that stock What cares about other L ones? I mean, I'll be honest. Maybe that was the reason why I got that perception But I think that by Lewis putting this out. It's a pretty strong signal to the ecosystem I think that everything stock was done up until this point makes you know, he's very a theorem aligned But at the same time it's more about the kind of like long term. So we'll see I mean the funny thing is that there's so many teams now that And I feel like other teams is still going to be deploying their roll-ups to other networks as well and even not they'll just get forked like At the end of the day I think What I am is like a roll-up maxi at this point unless something better comes along because roll-ups are just such an elegant solution To scaling not just zk roll-ups, but I stick that's ticket but optimistic roll-ups as well But we'll have to see I have to say how it plays out it's it's probably not good to be a maxi of anything in the ecosystem because Sometimes you can close your mind to other solutions But for me the way I think about it is that roll-ups took so long to come to fruition It literally took like what? Arbitrum or off-chain labs that build arbitrum they were working on roll-ups. I think 2014 they were trying to do for Bitcoin So and it wasn't called roll-ups back then it was something else, but you know it all evolved into roll-ups So for something better to come along to scale block chains I don't know. I feel like that's a pretty far away away, and if it did come along It was better than roll-ups, which are already amazing That would be even better like so I think for me I'm just like a scalability maximalist and a decentralization maximalist so whatever does so I guess like a decentralized scalability maximalist Whatever gets the job done in terms of scaling, but doesn't sacrifice the decentralization and security We all enjoy that is what I love to focus on because you can do scaling you know and call yourself a blockchain When in reality you just AWS with a token right like anyone could I could literally spin up a centralized server on AWS right now I could attach a token to it right like I would just fork some code put a token on it And then I could say look on a blockchain guys come use my blockchain and here's my token buy it Like and then I'd be super scalable because it's you know it's super centralized But like that defeats the whole purpose like why even have a blockchain in that case and the reason why is because you can monetize Or even if you aren't decentralized even if you kind of like don't care about that at all you can you can monetize like that So I think that's why I've seen a fair few of those networks kind of pop up But but yeah still good to kind of like keep your eyes open for for different kind of like scaling technologies out there besides roll-ups So the kintsugi merge testnet is now live so this is the long-lived testnet that I've been talking about over the last few weeks It's very easy to join you can test help test the merger kintsugi dot the merge dot dev It's got links to everything you need such as the beacon chain explorer eats that's the force at the RPC everything So if you want to join this testnet you can very easily just go to this link Click through whatever you need to add the network to minimize all that good stuff And you can join up and help the I guess like a theorem developers and researchers test out the long-lived merge testnet here Which obviously is critically important now this will run until I think mid-january For what I know on so we're gonna see the kind of like results of that see if things broke see you know how well it went and Then we'll probably have more of an idea of when the merge will be as I've said still sticking to my q2 estimate June 2022 seems like a pretty good date to do it, but that's me. That's my speculation Do not take that as gospel and please do not say do not take that as a to coin desk and be like I look Coin desk we you know we've got an exclusive date from Anthony's designer I'm not you know I'm not an Ethereum called ever anything like that Just following as I say it, but really cool to see that the kintsugi merge testnet is live And I think no that's it for the merge right now There was some screenshots that I saw but I figured they maybe weren't as relevant because you can join the testing yourself now I'm kind of like test it out yourself, so no need to kind of stick to the screenshots Anyway moving on so phone on Dow has or I guess like phone on has officially unveiled itself I've spoken about them before it's not like they've been in stealth or anything like that But they've basically introduced themselves what they are how there's going to be a token salt from grid plus tokens to phone on tokens And their advisors, so this is a perfect opportunity for me to say that I am an advisor to phone on I was approached by the Some of the good plus guys guys a few months ago I think and I said yes straight away because as I said my two Pillars that I'm focused on the most are privacy and scaling because I think believe they're the most important so anything got to do with Privacy and scaling well maybe not anything, but like anything that I think is legit I'm definitely going to to kind of be all in on so I'm very very happy to be an advisor to phone on they're building Awesome awesome tech guys like seriously secure like as they describe it here secure hardware Hardware for peer-to-peer off-chain transactions, which gives any crypto any crypto not just the theorem based crypto Any crypto the properties of physical cash transfers private fast and free I've explained how this work How this has worked before you can go give this blog post to read for a full overview of it links to resources And all the details about the token and how there's gonna be a token stop with grid Good the grid token and all that sort of stuff there, so really really cool to see this um I really like how basically it's I mean grid plus is awesome like obviously a few of you guys have the lattice one the hardware Wallet means awesome. I use it. It's just it's so great right it. I mean the people who have used it You'll know what I mean, but they had a token grid that they launched a long time ago And it didn't really do anything. It was very heavily owned by a few kind of like big Insiders, and it was kind of like worthless right didn't really fit in the picture But now they've kind of like done this thing with like okay Well we have this awesome product called phone on we can hook it up into our lattice one hardware wallets right And we have this kind of like token is not doing anything, so let's just replace it Let's just issue a new token. Let's convert people over and let's start again. Let's start a fresh Dow Let's get the community involved Let's let's do it from scratch And I love this approach to be honest because you basically have tech debt with old tokens like that Where essentially you're just kind of like okay? Well this token I mean especially when it comes to distributions so I think consensus had a major share in this because good plus is born out of consensus and If you actually want to credit Dow you can't have one entity controlling like a huge amount of the token supply So from that perspective what it needed to happen was that the grid tokens? I think a few of the big ones they burned a lot of their grid tokens And they got like a lesser share of the phone on token But the logic is is that the grid token wasn't really going anywhere so with the phone on token yes You have a lower share than what you had of grid, but phone was actually gonna go somewhere right it's potentially going to go up In value and it's going to have more success than the grid token So I'm really really glad they they did that and they checked that out there, but I mean as an advisor obviously I'm gonna I'm compensated in tokens as well, so don't take that as me saying go buy the token or anything like that I'm just explaining how the process worked there, and I thought it was pretty cool But yeah definitely go check out the overview blog post here. It gives you much more details So do not analytics is raising another round apparently at a 1 billion dollar valuation That's huge for an analytics company right guys, but we all love doing analytics. I love it I mean I've been a fan of them for a long time I should disclose that I'm a seed investor in them, but I've been using them for a long long time I mean I think since they came out because I used to share a lot of stats on Twitter about the growth of things like DeFi and kind of like other things on aetherium and doom was really the only place tracking It and I really love how anyone can create their own kind of doing analytics dashboards And just kind of like share them out like you know that no sequel can kind of go Go and create them and then kind of like credit for anything on chain So this is a massive kind of kind of race here 1 billion dollar valuation. That's huge I mean, this is a series B. They recently did their series a it seems that investors are very hungry for Blockchain analytics, and why wouldn't they be I mean on chain data is going to I mean on chain That is basically the new kind of like The new oil I mean it's funny because like people said data was the new oil I would say that blockchain data is the new oil to the data I mean, maybe that doesn't make sense But I think it's more valuable than your regular data, and you know I know it's all open on the internet for everyone to see But the only reason you can see a lot of it is because these tools extract it for you if you wanted to extract the Data yourself from the blockchain you would have to spin up your own full and archival nodes have to spin up your own infrastructure You'd have to build all your supporting infrastructure around it in order to sort through the data and kind of like um display it nicely like eat the scan does and like doing analytics does and all that sort of stuff and It would cost you a lot of money to do that That's why we all use these third-party tools and not just not just money But time and effort too because if you don't know what you're doing you have to learn how to do it So I think that that's why these investors are hungry for that for these sorts of To invest in these sorts of companies And it makes sense because going forward this data is just going to get more and more valuable for everyone not just for us crypto Enthusiasts, but for literally everyone I mean especially places like the tax officers They're very interested in this stuff for better or worse guys and as I said like Privacy is so important because anything you're doing on layer one aetherium now is not private I mean yes, you could have an address that you haven't shared with anyone But if that address ever ever touches an a centralized exchange It's cursed forever right because you've obviously ky said on that exchange or if someone figures it out somehow by doing Mapping of addresses it all takes is once literally all it takes is once for you to do the wrong sense And it's somewhere you shouldn't of and you've broken all privacy for that address forever, and it's also retroactive everything You've done up until that point that they can now see it if they you know and they can now identify it so I think It's kind of like a double-edged sword here where the analytics companies are awesome because they give us all the data with it We want to look at but at the same time they also give not I mean the irs isn't bad guy But they also give anyone the data that they want so you know you kind of look lose all the privacy there But still awesome to see this kind of like rays coming in from doing analytics here But speaking of data analytics platforms is also Nansen that actually announced that they've raised a 75 million dollar series B Which I believe um Values the company at 750 million dollars. I believe I can't click at the into the announcement because my internet's not on right now But they raised this it was led by Excel ventures with its patient from a 16z Tiger global fund that a bunch of others here a bunch of a bunch of angels as well I don't think they list the angels here, but Nansen is another one I mean if I was to pick the top two kind of like data analytics companies right now in aetherium There are other ones like kind of like that focus more on Bitcoin But in aetherium it would definitely be doing and Nansen and they're kind of like neck and neck here I mean Nansen isn't too far behind at a 750 mil valuation Do not a one bill and what's 250 million among friends right guys? But yeah, no congrats to Nansen on this raise. I mean this is just a rumor by the I mean not a rumor with doing analytics, but it's more of kind of like a not an official thing yet But I'm sure it's reliable because the block published it, but this is Nansen's actual right so the actual series B And you know the funny thing is I do wonder with these things if they're gonna do a token or not I actually don't know like even though I'm a seed investor and doing analytics. I don't know anything about that They tend to keep it kind of like under wraps if there is a and and you know some some teams when you invest earlier We'll be like oh well You know here's a soft a simple agreement for future tokens But like that's that's basically saying well if we do a token your equity will be converted into tokens It's not saying that they will do a token So it doesn't even matter if a project you invest in gives you a soft doesn't mean they're gonna do a token So you never really know until they're kind of like one day just email the investors about okay You know where we're thinking of tokenizing. This is how it's gonna go This is kind of like your share all that sort of stuff there So I'm curious to see if Nansen or doing are going to tokenize I think Nansen has been teasing it for quite a while don't think I've seen doing do that before But still I I mean, I don't even know what the token would be would it be like an equity token? I don't know because they you know doing an answer not paying customers. It's kind of weird when you think about it Will it create like a will they kind of dow around it? Maybe not sure but anyway, we'll see how that plays out I'm kind of on time here. So I want to get the last two updates So Toby Shopify CEO has kind of like shared this link saying you Shopify for your NFT drops So it seems you can now do NFT drops via Shopify you can join their beta program by clicking on this link so you can mint lists out and Sell your own branded NFTs with Shopify and Shopify payments now those who don't know Shopify is like kind of like an e-commerce a website where What did was it made anyone a let anyone kind of like set up their own store front right their own digital kind of like Storefront without needing to know how to design a website. So just made it super simple I've used Shopify before it's actually really really simple to use and they have preset themes and the backend interface They have is really cool So I think that's what they're trying to do here where they're basically saying well Let's do what we did for e-commerce for NFTs and it probably will work because they have such a large customer base But at the same and user base not just customer I guess the yeah customer base because you have to pay to use it But in saying that there was also as we've all seen a lot of kind of I guess blowback against NFTs lately Right and a lot. I mean, you know, it's funny like I've seen the game is blowback a lot and I actually understand where the game is it coming from because For them NFTs from big triple-a companies represent just another cash grab because how many of us have played games? You know over the last few years and seen them just become more and more of a cash grab with loot boxes with Kind of like day passes or kind of like I don't know annual passes or something with day one DLC Right, which should have just been included in the base game So I don't actually blame gamers for being angry that these it feels like this triple-a game game to just come game companies Are just hopping on a bandwagon when it comes to NFTs, which they probably are to be honest, but at the same time I Think what needs to happen is that there needs to be kind of a balance here where these triple-a game companies Should do NFTs, but they shouldn't do it in a way that it feels extractive to people They should do it in a way that it actually gives the power to the players and basically says to them Hey, we're gonna do NFTs, but instead of you having to buy it You can earn them in game and you can trade them among amongst yourself or something like that Right rather than kind of like trying to suck more money out of people which you know That's what the game video game video game industry has been doing for quite a while because it works You can literally I mean how many times is the same game just being kind of like rehashed and re-brought out Every year with a different kind of like yeah attached to it I know a lot of the sports games really just feel like clones of their previous years But you just kind of slap another year on it and because it's kind of like a quote unquote staple for console gamers And you know, I might even come bundled with the consoles They just sell out and there's just all this money that gets made So yeah, I understand the blowback from gamers against NFTs, but still cool to see Shopify doing an NFT market I mean that's just competitive with coinbase. I would say and you know, even open see I guess All right last up here. I theorem.org has launched a new page about a theorem energy consumption Basically explaining how a theorem is going to reduce its energy consumption by 99% now as we all know It's going to do this because of the merge right going from proof of work to proof of stake now I don't need to explain it to you guys, but you can link this page to anyone that may be asking you You know what? We know if you're just so much energy Is there any kind of plan to fix this link on the page? It'll explain it all to them you won't have to go through the merge with them or anything like that They can basically learn it we you know from from directly from a theorem.org which I think is really really cool But on that note, I think that's gonna be it for today.

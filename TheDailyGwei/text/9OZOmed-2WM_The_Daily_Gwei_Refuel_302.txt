 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily gray refuel worry cap the latest news in the ether make a system I'm your host and there's a signer and there's a 27th of January 2022. All right, everyone. Let's get into it So first on the agenda for today is this brand new website from the ether alpha alpha team called Client diversity org which is a resource website geared towards a theorem client diversity as the name implies here This website is really awesome I mean you can see here I've been talking about client diversity a lot on the beacon chain lately But you can see here basically a real-time dashboard or maybe not real-time But like a I guess like an updated dashboard on what the client diversity landscape looks like right now Now as I mentioned to you guys last time prism has you know A pretty big share of the network right now at about sixty six point one seven percent lighthouse following in its second place eighteen point seven percent take you at nine point or four percent and In this at five point two one percent and then the other three minority clients under one percent there So I guess I mean I've talked about client diversity a lot recently on the refuel and about why it's important for the beacon chain To not just be dominated by one client. There's been a lot of work being done, especially from the eats They stake a community. There's been a lot of outreach happening behind the scenes I'm aware of especially to major exchanges and staking service providers and things like that We definitely want to get the ball rolling here Because at the end of the day like I can encourage you guys as solo stakeholders to change if you're running prism to something else And we can get like a lot of individuals to do this but the thing is is that it it won't move the needle as much as getting one of the bigger providers to do this because If we can get an exchange or a staking service provider to essentially not you know stop using prism all together But change to a setup where they can use you know all four of the major clients In kind of like equal parts or if they want to they can have like 50% prism and 25% a lighthouse and or 25% another client and then twelve and a half percent for the other two but A lot of them are running like a hundred percent prism now, and that's why prism is so dominant So we definitely want to get that down to below 60% at least Ideally below 50% but as I said to you guys I think that's going to be a little bit difficult to get there especially before the withdrawals are enabled on the beacon chain which actually Comes about six months after the merge, so I think we're going to be having this kind of issue probably for the remainder of this year But it's still good that there's a lot of initiatives happening happening around this and you can see on this website You know why is client diversity not optional and there's a description here basically and you know as I've said to you guys if two-thirds of validators are kind of like you know reaching finality and those two-thirds make up one client and that client has a bug then The validators basically go onto that chain that the bug chain that becomes the canonical one and it can't be kind of like Returned to the real chain without being slashed unless it was done as part of like a hard fork or a social layer thing And that's obviously very very messy. There's further reading here. There's a bunch of resources you can read about client diversity if you want to get more involved there, and there's a bunch of Links to the clients here as well to kind of like change there, and there's also guides This is the one thing that I actually requested from people I'm like you know Guides would make a lot of sense and it's really actually simple here you can click from whichever client you're coming from so you're coming From prism you want to go to lighthouse click to and search guides and will bring up some guides for you to to play around With and I'm sure there'll be more guides added here over time so if you're a solo staker, and you're on prism right now There's pretty much no excuse not to change to one of these other clients, and it's you know those other clients aren't bad clients They're pretty much on par with prism from what I know I think prism just had the brand awareness at the start much more than the other kind of like clients did But from what I know from what I've seen the clients are pretty much all All the same essentially right in terms of kind of functionality in terms of performance Some of them you know probably inch out some better performance than others But they're mostly the same and I think the reward difference you would get is is probably you know I think actually I think one of the minority clients has a better Better better reward sorry will give you more awards than the majority clients And they will kind of like based on the protocol rules as well, so yeah definitely go check out this website It's got all the resources you need here. I'm very glad to see this, but as I said I don't mean to discourage people from changing over by saying that I don't think it's going to move the needle enough if The solo stake is change over because most solo stakeholders won't change like that's just the way it is Especially not before withdrawals are enabled because what people are worried about is screwing something up And if you screw something out you won't be able to Restake until withdraws are enabled because your funds will be stuck if you get kicked out of the validator set So it's kind of like potentially a year where you wouldn't be staking And you could get slashed and I totally understand people's hesitation to to change But I mean if you're not worried about that then definitely change in your running prism Definitely consider changing to one of the other clients out there So ethereum.org has a brand new page That kind of like runs you through how to run an ethereum full node And why you would want to do this and all that good stuff there So I have obviously talked about this a lot on the refuel over the the months and why you should do it But this is like a very very simple guide of how to get started a bunch of different ways to get started and And to kind of like run your own node kind of like hardware requirements for this as I said to you guys You be real I mean the biggest hardware requirement is probably just stay on SSD and they're pretty cheap these days So about a two terabyte SSD would would work here, and then a bunch of links to other things and also The guides to staking your a from stuff like that so very very cool to see this page from the ethereum.org website here If you're not running an ethereum full node yet And you have the capacity to do so I would highly recommend doing it because I mean you're helping the health of the network by Doing it yes, you're not getting any rewards for from it But you were definitely helping the the network state decentralized And this is the main reason why we keep the network you know so limited at layer one We want to make it so that people can run full nodes whenever they want and I think you know as a theory ends out Our duty is to run a full node if we're able to like and if you can afford to I mean it's not a cheap endeavor If you don't have a PC that you leave on all the time Then you know you probably need to buy a separate PC that you that you would kind of like have as your dedicated Dedicated station for running a full node on so I totally get it, but at the end of the day It's not super expensive, but still if you even it only if you're able to do it You should do it you shouldn't force yourself to do it or anything like that But but yeah this guide will help you with that if you're interested So the block is reporting that Consensus is poised to double its valuation in a pending fund raise now I don't know. I remember what their last valuation was I think it's yeah, yeah, so They've their last valuation was three point two billion dollars a little over two months ago That's I that I covered back then and so if they double that valuation it'll be six point four billion dollars or six point five Billion dollars, I don't think consensus commented on this report from the block, but the blocks pretty good So I'm sure this kind of like is very accurate here now The reason why I wanted to talk about this was because it's just crazy to see how far this stuff has come because Like I don't know how many of you were around back in 2018 in 2019 But consensus was really struggling for funding they had to cut stuff There was a kind of like I'm pretty sure a consensus was basically being run off Joe Lubens eith stash, right? He was selling eith to to kind of like keep the company afloat and no one wanted to invest Any large sums into consensus from from from kind of like from memory here because no one really wanted to invest large sums into Into crypto in general because people either wrote it off or it just wasn't a hot area I wasn't considered a place that you that you could put your money now Obviously fast forward a couple years and it's a night and day difference people would be a clamoring to invest in everything They're clamoring to invest in consensus because the consensus is is you know for all in terms of purpose is a very successful company They're the company that created metamask and in Fura and truffle suite and a bunch of other things out there that a lot of people Use they've funded a lot of a lot of different things in the ecosystem They've been a force for good a very very positive force So no wonder you know people are clamoring to kind of um I guess invest in them especially because they want to get exposure to metamask as well. I mean metamask is an absolutely massive tool Yes, people hate on it all the time, but doesn't matter They have tens of millions of active monthly users And that's nothing to scoff at especially crypto users who are using it for financial transactions and all that sort of stuff there So not much more details about this fundraise But I'm sure it's going to be have participation from all the names that we all know I'm terms of like VCs I've also it's also got me wondering if consensus is going to do a token themselves or if they're going to go public It would probably make sense for them to go public not actually do a token so just list on the stock It's not a stock exchange or the you know in New York or something because they're a us-based company I don't think it would make sense for them to do a token I don't see why that what brentford that would bring to them I don't see consensus wanting to become like a dow Um, but maybe they do maybe this was kind of like Joe Lubin's goal along maybe he wants consensus to become a true Dow And really the only way to do that is to have a token attached to it But I don't know I'm not convinced but we'll have to see you know, even investing for equity and for for shares if Consensus was to list on the on the stock market would still offer up a pretty decent return because I'm sure metamask will eventually Tokenize and that kind of like and obviously consensus will learn a large chunk of that and that'll be worth You know billions if not tens of billions of dollars I reckon that you know then you have all the other properties that they kind of make money off of and then you have like the consulting services and Auditing services. So definitely makes sense there. But yeah, really really cool to see Consensus are raising another round just such a night and day difference between what it was like two to three years ago You know struggling for funding massive layoffs hundreds of people getting losing their job So what we are what we are where we are today where consensus seems to you know Not be struggling for money at all anymore actually probably having too much money thrown at them from what I've seen from the other private Markets over the last few months. So yeah, I'll cover this when it is I guess like officially public We just wanted to kind of I guess a signal boost that there So yesterday arc invest which is a very popular in kind of like fund in the traditional finance space That's been making moves into crypto recently published I guess one of their investment kind of reports here and they were pretty heavy on crypto So they kind of talked about crypto a lot in this report and they also mentioned that they believe eats market cap could exceed 20 trillion in the next 10 years now I quote tweeted this and I said I tend to agree Now you guys know that I have said You know plenty of times before that I believe over the next five to ten years It really has a shot of going to a ten trillion dollar market cap Which would put it, you know Depending on the eat supply based on the burn things like that would put it anywhere from 80 to 100 K Per kind of like token here It really depends on how much we're burning and and things like that and it really depends if it happens in five years or ten Years, so but yeah, I added it to 100 K depending on the supply there now You know arc invest is saying that they think it's can go to 20 trillion in ten years and look I'm not gonna disagree with that like I think you know, obviously it'd be nice if it went there but I actually don't think it's too far-fetched to say that because I think what ends up happening in crypto or in just like general with a lot of things Is people just don't I mean humans can inherently don't do well with exponential growth They kind of like a very linear based where it's kind of like a cave something's growing, you know slowly over time They kind of understand that but it's when you kind of hit exponential growth humans have a really tough job But kind of like rectifying that or I'm coming to terms with that it not rectifying When what's the word I'm looking for reconciling that's in in their head because I think about it like Most of our lives are linear and not exponential what we feel like us aging is a linear process. It is not exponential We don't just jump from like age 1 to 20, right? We go 1 2 3, you know in a linear kind of fashion Whereas a lot of this exponential growth that we see within tech and particularly when we talk about network effects happens so so quickly that it just blindsides us like I you know, for example We think crypto a protocol can have like 10 million dollars of TVL And then the next day it can literally have a billion dollars of TVL just literally overnight And people underestimate how quickly that can happen because it's just it's very foreign to us unless you you know You're in the weeds and you're actually diving deep into this sort of stuff I think the same applies to pricing, you know right now it's market cap is what three hundred and something billion dollars 120 billion or something like that Billion-dollars, I think I think it might be less than that depending on the price, you know, depending what the price is there But essentially to get the 20 trillion, obviously, it's a it's a you know, it's a slug from here but it could happen relatively quickly if you actually study what the crypto kind of like ecosystem looks like much of the major price moves are done in a relatively short period of time and then a lot of the time is just kind of like Trending sideways for a while and kind of like correcting and just like I'm finding a new bottom So I think that's you know, maybe 20 trillion in 10 years. Maybe a bit bit optimistic I still think we can see 10 trillion But it's good to see these kind of like signals coming from the more traditional world Because I think that you know, they're kind of like waking up to the fact that ETH is you know The premier collateral within DeFi is a store of value It has like a risk-free kind of like internet bond with staking is you being used as money within it And if T's is going to become deflationary right has the burn and and things like that and has all the demand at the end Of the day and will scale so I think or you know You kind of like put all that together doesn't surprise me that These firms are kind of putting out reports like this and these investment reports go out to you know The non crypto people write a lot of non crypto people and especially people that They have all the wealth right like the older generations that have a lot of the wealth and I actually do believe over the next Few years, especially when it comes to staking there's going to be a lot of the a lot of staking products Repackaged by traditional finance institutions and sold on sold to these people and it's going to bring in a ton of money into this space So I actually don't think it's far-fetched to say the market cap could exceed 20 trillion in the next 10 years It's not a guarantee of course just just kind of like my belief just arc invest belief and it's not investment advice It's just that it's just kind of like a price target there and obviously arc has as far as I know I think they have a bit of an eighth position. Obviously I have any position but I think You know if everything goes right for aetherium and eighth as an asset I don't see a reason why this this can't happen 10 years is actually quite a long time when you think about it I mean, you know the relative to a lot of different things you can think back 10 years Like what the world looked like 10 years ago was very very different to what it is today, especially the tech world So that comes back to exponential growth and how quickly these things can can go absolutely bananas So very very cool to see that arc investors put out this kind of like target here We'll see if they're right maybe you know, I'm I want to say I'll still be doing the refuel in 10 years I hope I am I don't know if I will or not But you know if I am still doing the refuel in 10 years then definitely Will will will try to remember to come back to this maybe I should do a a reminder underneath my own tweet and say remind Me in 10 years right to see if they were right, but I'm sure at that point we'll know or not So nifty island is out with another teaser video today I think yesterday actually I think I missed this one of my friends pointed out to me But basically this is a very early alpha demo of the nifty island game world here of the metaverse world Looks like a bunch of buildings around here And and you know their character v booter and he's jumping around a few different kind like floating little islands I guess but I mean you guys know I'm really looking forward to this game. I've been following it for quite a while I have my you know legendary neon palm I have my my nifty blade and all that sort of stuff But I'm really looking forward to being able to finally play the game because for me look I like or love nfts in general But I I'm just so uninspired by all the copy paste and you know 10,000 profile picture nfts I've said this to you guys before I'm just looking forward to being able to do stuff with my Nfts and to bring them into game worlds to show them off to hang out with my friends to do VR stuff like I Just want more of that I want less of I mean buy a profile picture and choose between the 10 other perfect job Perfect pictures that you bought because you can only have one right you can only have one profile picture on Twitter And if you keep changing it it kind of confuses people as well, so that's another reason Why I'm not really a big fan of that and it feels like a lot of them are just people kind of like flipping flipping the The other profile pictures which is fine. I have nothing wrong with that, but it's just it's uninteresting right like I feel like The more interesting aspect is being able to bring all of our items into these you know open game worlds open metaverses I hang out with friends do cool stuff with it rather than just staring at it at our open sea kind of like profile right so Cool to see these from nifty island. I can't wait for their their the alpha to go live soon So a Bartek is out with another great thread about our Why independent monitoring of roll-up parameters is important so in this thread? He's taken a look at anti censorship mechanism of arbitrum and using their Jan 9 a sequencer outage Which was a nine hour outage as an example here, so I highly recommend giving this rate I giving this thread a read I've seen a few if every people kind of like ask about this sort of stuff and asked asked about what happened with kind of like Arbitrum asked about like what's you know? What's the what's the go with kind of like censorship and censorship resistance and things like that and what you can do to exit? To L1 and all that sort of stuff, so I just wanted to kind of like point this out to you guys Definitely go check out this thread for a read on that and in a related kind of I guess post here one from hexo naught who wrote an article about deploying your token or DAP to L2 first and then Mental model to switch involved with making this choice, so I've always seen some discussions recently about how when you deploy your Contract to arbitrum optimism on L2 only You can do that, but then if you want to exit to L1 or have it on our one You have to deploy to L1 as well Which is obviously a larger cost than it is on L2 There's a lot of kind of things coming for developers to make this an easier process and in this kind of blog post hexa Not describes a bit of this and and and you know goes through Eric walls tweet who actually started discussion around this and how we Can kind of like I guess like um fix this and how we can kind of like make this flow better for developers So if you're a dev definitely go check this out. It should be very interesting for you So investor finance today announced that they are conducting their treasury bootstrapping event using prime dow's a prime liquid launch an interface for conducting liquidity bootstrapping pool events so if you're interested in getting started with this So if you're interested in getting your hands on this you can definitely check this out I don't usually bring up token sales, but there's two you know two reasons Why I'm bringing it up one. I'm an investor in investor, and I'm actually super excited about this project They're launching natively on layer 2 and I've told you guys plenty of times And I'm very very excited about layer 2 native projects and 2 I've seen a lot of people in the discord channel talking about vesla So I felt that was just very relevant for you guys out there Don't want to show you too much on it. Please you know don't buy this on my recommendation I'm not even recommending you to buy it. I'm just pointing out that they're going to have this treasury bootstrapping event So just think just because I know a lot of you guys interested in it I didn't want you to miss out or anything like that So you can definitely check out the thread and the blog post for more details on how this is all going to work here It's a pretty interesting mechanism So so yeah, definitely have a have a have a look at this in the YouTube description below So Paul Miller here released an ethereum cryptography 1.0. Which was funded by the ethereum foundation So this is a new audited library set behind and and behind that will empower all kinds of projects in the space So you can it's basically a cryptography stack for developers for researchers for all that good stuff there If you're not a developer or a researcher that handles cryptography stuff then this probably isn't going to be very relevant to you But I figured I'd point it out for those people out there who were who were kind of like interested in this and you know It's funny because I've seen some discussions around you know Why would you want your own L1 over an L2 and one of the one of the answers was? That with your own L1 you have control over things like what cryptography it uses Obviously if you images its own set of cryptography and the EVM does as well and that's not likely to change anytime soon Whereas if you want to use something custom you can't do I mean you can do it at an L2 to an extent But you're still kind of like a subject of L1 Cryptography but like if you wanted to you could have your own L1 and do whatever you want on there I think that's like a very niche thing. I don't think it's actually a selling point. I don't think in most projects Almost all projects should ever be spitting up their own L1 It doesn't make sense for a number of reasons as I've outlined before But this you know, Ethereum cryptography stack basically runs through what you can do With a theorem cryptography and how it covers a lot of the the major case use cases that you would want here So definitely go check out this if you're interested in that sort of stuff So connects tweeted out they've done that they've done some gas cost reductions So they've been analyzing gas consumed on every roll-up chain that they support to optimize their estimates Eg you can see optimism below and now because of that fees are now 30 to 40 percent cheaper throughout the entire Connects the network here. This is awesome I mean as I've said to you guys plenty of times before I've talked about this so much lately these networks these bridges is L2's they're so early and they're gonna optimize the shit out of their gas because that's their selling point a lot of the time like The bridges selling point obviously is twofold One is being able to bridge quickly in and out of L2's and different chains But two is being able to do that cheaply because there's no use being able to bridge between things if it's super expensive to do And the same goes for optimism where or kind of like these L2's where Obviously they want to kind of get their cost down as much as possible and that can all be kind of like taken holistically And users can just enjoy a very very seamless and cheap experience and obviously as more L1 upgrades come to aetherium that lower Kind of costs for roll-ups and things like that We're gonna have even better Optimizations there as well so super excited to see this from connects then yeah all this stuff's just gonna get so much better with time Guys like we're so so early. I mean if we're if you think we're early to crypto We're like a hundred times earlier to the L2 stuff and to the bridging and and to how big this thing is gonna get As I was saying before about exponential growth. You know we a lot of us Just can't fathom that like I I mean to be honest I probably can't even fathom it like how quickly this stuff is going to grow and how how much it's gonna grow by because You might be seeing today On aggregate all across like all the chains and layer twos we might be doing a few thousand transactions per second Maybe maybe that's right, and I'm talking successful transactions not like spam transactions that people count as being successful No, I'm talking about successful search action transactions that are executed at an execution layer Whether they be at layer one or layer two it's not more than a few thousand It's probably not even near a few thousand now I'm gonna tell you within the next ten years we could hit a point where that becomes millions of transactions per second and aggregate and successful transactions and that's Exponential from here right that's an absolutely a massive amount of growth and we need to keep costs down We can't have the cost going up with the transaction demand at the execution layers Obviously if you're our one is not always going to be very limited and the costs are going to go up But the point is is that users at these other execution layers such as roll-ups will be able to get the cheap experience of these roll-ups because They scale better with transactional demand and then then layer one does While being able to maintain security and decentralization here. So yeah, I mean honestly I should just set a reminder on my phone ten years from now watch the you know the refuel from from 2021 and 2022 and see how much you you know you were able to predict because I actually think that it might even happen faster Than ten years because of as I mentioned before exponential growth and how quickly that stuff can happen there So yeah, anyway, very cool to see this fear reduction here from connects Alright, so finally we have another blog post out of polygon titled zk verse polygons zero knowledge a strategy explained Which I'm very very glad they put this out because I've seen a fair few people ask me recently about Polygon zk strategy, you know now that they have these teams under their umbrella polygon Hermes might and nightfall and zero What's their strategy? You know, what are they gonna do with this? What's in store for the future when the user is going to be able to kind of like play around with them and in this Blog post they basically say well, you know, I'm not gonna be able to do this I blog post they basically go through the technology behind each solution the people behind them and the roadmap So if you're interested in any of this, you can definitely check out the blog post here I'm really glad they put this out because as I said people have been asking me about this and it can be confusing because you Might be thinking. Okay. Well, there's a polygon POS chain That's really the only thing that anyone uses today because the other stuff is I mean Hermes is live on main net But it doesn't really have any kind of like applications right now But you know everyone's wondering okay. Well, you know, there's the POS chain We're all using it But I want to use polygon zero zero knowledge kind of like roll up stuff and that's coming right like and this blog post Details that but it's gonna take longer than people think it will and as I've explained before This is exactly why I've been such a champion for optimistic roll-ups in the face of zk roll-ups Like even if zk roll-ups end up being like, you know in a couple years and not being like a million times better than optimistic Roll-ups on on costs and on speed and all that sort of stuff Optimistic roll-ups are live and working today. They've got adoption they have an ecosystem So let's kind of like use that sort of stuff but at the end of the day You know, I think we're gonna be using both for a very long time, which is fine I mean, you know you use what you want to use you use what you get value out of and I'm really excited to see more people use Use these kind of like tools no matter what they are and as I explained yesterday the layer 2 walls They're heating up right there in the layer 2 walls I have so many teams a part of them now and you know when I talk about the actual wars between the two I'm talking about the generalized platforms not so much the app specific ones Like for example example dy dx is roll up is not competing with arbitrums roll up It's not competing with optimisms. Whereas albertram optimism stark net zk sync and polygon solutions Are all competing on the generalized fronts and you know this I mean and obviously the optimism forks like boba and metis And I think nami as well or something like that They're all competing on that kind of generalized front there, but I've told you guys before that I don't expect there to be more than a few major winners in terms of kind of like having the most market share because of variety of different reasons But it's just how things kind of tend to play out with the Pareto principle there or kind of long You could kind of like Google that and check out the 80 20 rule same goes for our ones obviously I expect a theorem to matter to you know remain the dominant out one smart contract player Form and eventually replace Bitcoin as the dominant crypto network in you know by market cap But you know at the end of the day I think you know everything is competing with everything but all these competition is gonna be very very healthy And I'm super excited to see you know what polygon does with their solutions and in terms of like their zk solutions And I'm really really excited to see how everything else scales alongside it as well But I think on that note I I'm gonna hand it there for today, so Thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give the video a thumbs up subscribe to The newsletter join the disco channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow.

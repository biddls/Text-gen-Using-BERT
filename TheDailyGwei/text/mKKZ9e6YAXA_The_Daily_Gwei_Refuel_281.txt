 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Deligue Refuel where we cap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem I'm your host Anthony Sassano and today's the 28th of December 2021 Alright everyone, let's get into it. So as you can see actually on my screen, I only have four tabs open for today's Refuel It is actually been very very quiet on Twitter only natural given it's the holiday period so I figured today I'm going to go on a little bit of a rant about a tweet that I saw and it's gonna be an educational rant It's just gonna be me. I'm saying whatever I can kind of like expecting you guys to listen But I think it's important because what I aim to do with the Refuel At least one of my goals is to arm you guys with the knowledge you need to fight back against FUD Around Ethereum to learn more about Ethereum what it's actually trying to do You know things like why the layer one fees are high why it's not an overnight fix how this is all gonna work long term Just so you kind of like know on a fundamental level all that good stuff around Ethereum So, you know, as I said, I'm gonna go on a little bit of a rant here gonna talk about this tweet here from Tasha So yeah, I'll read out the tweet. So you guys know what I'm talking about So she put out a tweet today and actually before I read out the tweet I just want to say that this person I don't consider to be a good actor within the crypto ecosystem They are very clearly putting tweets out like this as a kind of form of growth hacking or kind of like engagement farming where they know that this will cause outrage and outrage is the easiest way to get Engagement on your tweet because everyone quote tweets it dunks on you replies to her correcting the misinformation And it's just a surefire way to grow a following and it's worked for her I mean, I remember a few months ago She only had like maybe a few tens of thousands of followers when I first saw her now She has over a hundred thousand followers. So it works, right? And it works wonders because that's just what Twitter and all these social platforms reward and it's what humans are kind of like Pre-programmed to pay attention to I mean I even replied to a tweet that I was tagged in about this Which just gave it more attention and you know, it's like even if you are conscious of what's happening It's still you know, you can still end up doing it So I just wanted to preface it by saying that I don't consider Tasha to be a good actor within the etherium ecosystem They are just doing kind of like engagement farming tactics, which I honestly, you know I mean I've used them before myself but like not in the sense of spreading misinformation to do it It's more in the sense of I know if I say something a certain way it might like, you know Kick the hornets nest a little bit But there's a difference between that and just spreading outright misinformation to cause outrage and to cause people to give your tweet engagement So we're given that context. I'll read out what she put what her tweet was today So she said a layer 2 without a token will find it hard to get traction a layer 2 with a token will be bearish For eat as users sell eat for out the layer 2 coin to chase growth Oh Alternately our ones don't have such a dilemma yet and thus remain more attractive If you think l2s are the cure to declining if dominance wake up, okay So let's let's go through this line by line the first line an l2 without a token will find it hard to get traction I agree with this I actually agree with this and this is the only part that I agree with because I've been saying for a few months now I believe that pretty much anything l1 l2 sidechain, whatever if it doesn't have token incentives on it It's not going to go very far. I mean if theorem had token incentives just not in the form of eat Like during the five summer there were plenty of projects that did their own token incentives and it was just being done on on a theorem So if theorem kind of like got all the traction because of that and you know We've seen other ecosystems copy the playbook and it works. There is obviously some form of liquidity that ends up being sticky It's like a very powerful marketing tool and all that good stuff there And you know, I do agree that we are now two without a token will find it hard to get traction So that that's the only part I agree with now on to the next line here Tasha says an l2 with the token will be bearish for eat as users sell eight for layer 2 coin to chase growth You know, this is a prevalent kind of narrative that I've seen kind of play out over the last you know, maybe few weeks coming to fruition because every time a Bad narrative gets debunked and and that narrative no longer is the consensus view of you know Many participants within the market they have to shift the goal process if they're trying to paint another narrative, you know First it was layer twos will never work. Then it would let was layer twos will never get traction now, it's Layer two coins are gonna be parasitic to Ethan and and you know take value from Ethan asset There's a fundamental reason why this is just outright wrong and that's because l2s have to pay Ethereum for security and they have to pay that in eighth and most of that eighth gets burned, right? You all know this like this is not anything new to you a second kind of like reason is that It is the unit of account for a lot of these or at least one of the top assets in a lot of these You know alternative l1s or side chains or or l2s, right? It is used as trustless collateral or a kind of like a trustless asset across all these all of these networks here, right? So you've got that aspect to it. The other aspect is of course staking right? There's a great graphic from Domothy I don't have up here now But it basically showed now I showed it on the refill before a flow chart of how ether cruise value no matter what's happening on the network and how that actually contributes to the security of the network and the decentralization of it the most basic example of this is that The higher the eighth value the more activity on the ether network the more fees that are being paid to validators post merge The more validators will come online because the APY will be high and the more validators that come online the more shards that we get the more decentralization we get for aetherium and Also, we get more capacity for L to to scale as well So he gets more scaling you know, you guys have heard me talk about kind of like Inverting the scalability challenge before and and how basically aetherium is the only platform aiming to do that right now At least the only one that's live. I thought it was a few other projects trying to do that as well So it's just outright wrong what she's saying here for those kind of reasons And then there's a bunch of other reasons as well that are kind of I guess like you could say reasons that that kind of like bolt on and kind of bolt on to the other reasons that are like the fundamental reasons just hang off the side of it and you you know you Guys will probably know the ones I would I would come up with at this point But the fundamental one is the fact that L twos will always have to pay a theorem for security if they are theory and based L twos, of course other chains can have L twos on them You know, that's that's all well and dandy But I've explained before how it doesn't actually make sense at all for another L to first Sorry for an L to to settle to another layer one you always want to settle to the most secure and decentralized base layer Which is aetherium by miles and there's nothing that even comes close and it's not just about Security and decentralization. It's also about long-term health You want to make you want to be sure that you can pull and liveness as well So as an L to operator or as an L to network you want to be sure that the security that you're purchasing That's essentially what you're doing If you're an L to that's kind of like putting your transactions on an L one like aetherium you're purchasing security You're purchasing guarantees that that data that transaction proof is going to be there at all times You know, it's going to the network is going to be live now Would you do that for a network that has gone offline multiple times like Solana? Would you take that risk? Probably not right maybe in the future sometime if the platform proves itself But right now as an L to operator you'd be crazy to do that would you do that on one of the newer chains that maybe I haven't experienced any kind of like Hardships and have like much lower security because their token price is much lower. You wouldn't do that either So, you know a perfect example of this is something like dy dx There's a reason they're still on a theorem even though the founder said that they would go to somewhere else if it made sense It doesn't make sense. That's the thing Like I think Paulina put out a tweet which I'm gonna go over where they actually quoted what dy dx is paying actual I'll talk about this now He Paulina said that dy dx earned sixty seven million dollars in October and paid 1.5 million dollars in gas fees for verifying and 0.5 million dollars for data availability So they paid two million dollars to outsource their security and then they profited 65 million now obviously there are other costs involved in that such as running the The off-chain staff and paying you know people and whatever but like that wouldn't be that wouldn't make much of a dent here So let's just say those costs are like five million dollars a month and they're not like I don't believe that They'd be that how I that's still 60 million dollars clear profit in October for for the idx after paying for their security So people who say oh it's so expensive for these L twos to pay for their security now one It really isn't because when you put in the context of how much money they're making it makes a lot of sense and that's just dy dx as a Single kind of like app on an app L to app based L to it's not the generalized one So you have that example there? And then Tasha goes on to say, you know alternative L ones don't have this dilemma of L two tokens Be a all two tokens build on top of them Are draining value from their base tokens? So for example an avalanche doesn't have L twos so the ad X token isn't being The value isn't actually being extracted to some L to token I don't think this logic makes any sense at all in the crypto markets the only in any market capital is always Sorry assets are always competing for capital against every other asset. Yes, there are cat there are categories like there are out There's the L ones there's the L twos there's D fires NFTs There's dows but a lot of the capital overflows like if you were to kind of like make a Venn diagram out of this It would probably be a circle, you know a lot of people who put money into defy also put money into NFTs also put money into L twos and L ones and All this sort of stuff and it's just the rotation game, right? I mean Kobe had a good blog post about this the other day about the meta game and how it's always Changing and people will rotate from one thing to the other and if you catch the meta game early You can profit really well from that. That's exactly what happened with a lot of these L ones people caught them early They profited from them when they were a much lower market cap They rode it up and they probably gonna rotate or take profits into what they actually want to hold for for me You know if I was riding it I would take profits into ef other people may take them into You know Bitcoin or some other assets or maybe they'll just keep them in that L one token that you know that that's an option As well, but the point I'm trying to make is that capital Sorry, the assets are always fighting for basically much of the same capital and there it's hard to quantify Of course because a lot of things are fungible and it's it's just very hard to get an accurate mapping there But from my experience I would say that just because an L2 token exists doesn't mean that it's directly Pulling value from eight doesn't mean that someone says kind of like, okay Well, I'm just gonna buy this L2 token and I'm not I'm not gonna buy eight I would actually argue that if you're buying an L2 token You probably have an eighth bag as well because you know that it's good faith that if the L2 takes off Let's take an example of you know, if Albatross has a token Would you just go 100% in to Albatross and that's it like Albatross token? You probably wouldn't you'd be like, okay Well Albatross is on a theorem. It's paying a theorem for its security So and it's only one thing paying a theorem for its security and it has all these other value accrual properties So I'm gonna buy eight as well and you know the sophisticated sophisticated investor is actually probably not even gonna compare the two because they're from different categories like eighth value accrual is very very different to an L2 tokens value accrual and there's different reasons for each one to accrue or not accrue value So I just think these comparisons are just really weird, right? And I think that the relative trade works maybe short to medium term But long term it doesn't really work that well and by relative trade I mean that when you kind of look at these old L1s They are definitely trading as a kind of percentage of a theorem people say, okay Well, if you know is worth half a trillion dollars This L1 is worth 10 billion dollars. That means that if this L1 becomes 10% of the value of Of of um of a theorem it can go to 50 billion dollars, which means it's a 5x from here These things are done are being done, right? But the thing is is that that's that's kind of like being done for every single asset we've in crypto and outside of crypto every single category and as I said, I believe that everything is always fighting for capital and Also fighting for attention and I've covered this in a video that I put out a few months Maybe a couple months ago now where basically said attention is the scarcest resource in crypto and if you get the attention you get the the capital and you get The you know the price performance like look at all the old L1s They've gotten all the attention over the last few months and that's why they performed so well and it's kind of like a feedback loop or the more attention they get the The better they perform and the better they perform the more attention they get and it becomes kind of like this Self-fulfilling thing all these kind of like really nice flywheel effect there But the same is going to be true for anything like what we see we have like we have like defi mania Then we had NFT mania and then we had an FTE mania again It seems that right now NFT seems to be making a little bit of a move I'm sure we're gonna have an L2 mania. So when you kind of like look at it in that context It doesn't matter if it's an alt L1 or L1 or an L2 or a sidechain or whatever doesn't matter about it's kind of like Like category what matters is is basically where the capital is allocating what it's allocating for and the reason someone is going to buy Something over another thing like for example I don't think most people are actually buying the alt L1 tokens because they believe that they're Fundamentally sound and I'm gonna accrue a lot of value I believe a big reason that they're buying it is narrative right everyone's been like, oh, you know if theorem has high gas fees I'm gonna play these L ones because they have lower gas fees and they have a good narrative behind them And also they're doing it because they they're kind of pushing a narrative that okay Well, there's a relative trade to be had here this plays out time and time again in every category you can think of so I don't think that The alt L ones don't have such a dilemma because the dilemma doesn't even exist The the real dilemma is basically the investors choice of what to put their money into regardless of what category it is And obviously within the category you can compare things But you when you when you start doing that you go beyond narratives and you go into kind of the fundamental analysis So so yeah That's that point there and then just to wrap this up Her last kind of sentence was if you think L2s are the cure to declining ETH dominance wake up This is just like pure bait. I think it's just really really there to kind of like engagement farm to cause outrage I don't think if dominance is something that needs to be cured or needs to be fixed or anything like that I think that dominance is a flawed metric because if you're measuring dominance in terms of TVL well, we all know that TVL is a flawed metric to begin with and also as kind of like as Crypto grows as the pie gets bigger and as more kind of like incentives coming to play It was never going to remain at 100% dominance or near 100% dominance It doesn't matter if it had five feet high fees or not I actually have a theory that the high fees on a theorem is not what caused these is not the main reason why these L1s Kind of like took off the main reason these L1s took off is because of the fact that they had token incentive programs I can guarantee you that if ETH had low fees and these other chains You know say it had near zero fees if these other chains still had their token incentive programs They would still have gotten similar traction to what they have today Because people just want to make money like you just go back to the fundamental thing of why most people are in this industry They want to make money a lot of them want to make quick money and a lot of them want to ride Narratives and that's how they invest because of the fact that it's so hard to invest in crypto That writing the narrative is the easiest kind of decision for a lot of people so from that perspective I believe that that would have played out the same way regardless of high fees or not so ETH dominance is not really a metric I look at What I basically look at is you know if anything EVM dominance like how dominant is If there is technology across the ecosystem because that is the real network effect the EVM seems to be the moat Right now like these other ecosystems that are trying to do something other than EVM I'm having a very hard time getting traction like for all the narrative spun about You know as an example Solana, which doesn't use the EVM on natively It has a different kind of like a setup there for all the narrative spun there and all the people kind of going on about How much usage it has if you actually look under the hood it has way way way less usage than the EVM side chains Or you know other EVM chains out there So I think that building an ecosystem is tough building a narrative is easy And that's why you see lots of these things kind of like playing out there, so anyway I'm gonna leave it at there for Tasha's tweet. There's a follow-up tweet here from Polina that basically They started the tweet by saying I've gotten a few questions about value accrual on layers And they say hate to break it to you Execution layer highly competitive tight margins a race to the bottom we can see this from alt L ones where the sole gimmick is accruing As little value as possible and they go on in this thread to explain basically what they mean by this But the TLDR here is basically that People are asking the question of like where is the value going to accrue is it going to accrue at the sediment layer is? It going to accrue in these l2 tokens is it going to accrue somewhere else and the question that the real kind of like Answer to this is no one knows But I also think that as Polina points out here in the execution layer Which which which includes the l2s and these highly perform a highly scalable l1s that they're trying to do everything at l1 It's extremely competitive It's tight margins because if you're offering low fees you have to basically undercut the competition But by doing that you're not really accruing much value to your native token because the fees are so low So it really is a race to the bottom whereas as a settlement layer you keep fees high because you're offering Strong decentralization security and liveness guarantees so you can afford to do that and that's exactly what a theorem l1 is optimizing to do So I would argue that the settlement layer regardless of if people directly invest in it or not Over the long term is going to have the best value accrual and when it comes to a theorem for for an example here I mean one for ARP one five five nine is that key because it basically leads to everything else falling into place And I've gone through the value accrual pillars plenty of times But with one five five nine it doesn't matter if people are investing in ETH and they're aware of the ETH bullcaste or whatever or anything Like that it doesn't matter if all people are doing is using l2s They're paying ETH for security regardless of what they're doing if the Ethereum settlement layer is still being used It is still being like it's block space is still being purchased It is still leading leading to burnt ETH it is still leading to fees going to validate the unburnt fees going to validators Which is leading to a higher APY which is leading to more ETH being staked Which means more ETH gets taken off the market which naturally leads to ETH value accrual over time So I strongly believe that most of the value will accrue in two places one at the settlement layer and two at the at the application layer because applications are distinct from from the L1s and L2s because you can bet on just like with the application itself without having to kind of think about all the generalized things and you can basically benchmark them and do PE ratio stuff and price of sales ratios and they're not trying to be money or anything like that or store values they're very easy to to kind of like to evaluate But like in saying that I don't think that the L2 tokens are going to be worth nothing I just think that a lot of them are going to have You know difficult time accruing lots and lots of value over something like like a settlement layer So for example, if if if the Earth market cap goes to ten trillion dollars Where does that put one of the top performing l2 market caps? I don't know. I honestly have no idea I couldn't tell you is it going to be a 1% of each value at a hundred billion dollars? Or is it going to be 10% at a trillion dollars? I couldn't tell you I would actually err on the side that it would be a lot less than than the settlement layer So maybe in the one to five percent area, so a hundred to five hundred billion Which is nothing to scoff at by the way, that's huge, right? That would basically mean it's as successful as a really as a big tech company, which which is fine But I think it's too early to tell we don't know for sure But I do strongly believe that the settlement layer is where most of the value will accrue over the long term and I'm you know The funny thing is is that you can point to other kind of on tokens that have outperformed eight this year plenty plenty have but it's all about kind of I guess the extra risk you're taking on the Market cap difference like eighth at a half a trillion dollar market cap is not going to pump like something that starts at a hundred Million dollar market cap. It's just wildly different are for a number of different reasons liquidity profile investor profile narratives All that sort of stuff there, but over the long term I'm talking long long term like five ten twenty thirty years This is the question that's being perfect. Where does that value accrue? And I strongly believe it accrues to the sentiment layer in the very long term So, you know, that's the way I play it with my portfolio. I position myself Mostly eighth, but I make other plays as well knowing that a you know, eight is a solid long term bet And you know, I could have more validators and stack more validators But if you want higher reward you have to take on more risk and you go play in other things and that's not to say That nothing else is a good long term investment either But as we've seen play out in the market most things aren't actually lot good long term investments, especially when bet match mark against eighth So that's what you have to kind of like make your own decisions and make your own investment theses about that But anyway, give this thread from Polina a read it goes into a bit more detail about this but that's just my view on things and you you guys know that I believe like eight is going to That ten trillion dollar market cap over the long term regardless of what the narrative say regardless of if people hate if you're him or not It's always funny when I see that because if you're him I think is the most polarizing chain or polarizing ecosystem within crypto for for many many different reasons I think that it has just as many people who like it as hate it I think the people who hate it don't exactly hate it They basically want to use it, but they can't because they're priced out So that's why you know the L2 ecosystem We have a chance to get them back because at the end of the day as I said before Most people just want to make money So if they can make money from these L2s when they do tokens and your token incentive programs, they're gonna migrate so fast They're not gonna care if they hate aetherium or not They're gonna come and use it because they want to earn that money like it, you know Being emotional about things and hating something and not investing in it Just because you hate it is Definitely a way to miss out on gains and I think most people realize that and most people are Very finicky with their views on things and as I've mentioned before As soon as these L2 start doing tokens, you're gonna notice a very rapid narrative shift It's going to be oh, you know, I love aetherium aetherium is great. Like this is awesome Why am I gonna use one of these other L1s when aetherium scales at L2? It's got this, you know all these opportunities for me to make money I'm just gonna stay here and there's gonna be like ebbs and flows there, you know I'm sure the L1s that stick around will do something to kind of like try and take market share back But obviously I am you know Super long-term bullish on the L1 the L2s and if you're him as that settlement layer, but yeah I'll link this thread in the YouTube description for you to have a read of it So I guess like in a related tweet here from super super fears and I wrote a newsletter about this today He put out a tweet where he said what if investing in a theorem doesn't mean buying coins and turning a profit What if it means collaborating to build a highly decentralized network that benefits everyone in the world for hundreds of years? If there can be less about money and more about humanity, so I want to just talk briefly about this But what I think this tweet perfectly encapsulates is the two main parties we have in crypto We have the profit maximalist I hear the people who are here really only for money and the technology is either secondary a Second like learning about technology getting involved with it is a secondary objective for them or is really not in there kind of like Realm of things they care about it all and then you have the people that are you know Mostly in it for the technology and the money is kind of like a nice a nice bonus for them and they're investing in it with their money because they want to share in the upside but really they fundamentally care about the technology and making a You know technology that can actually be better for humanity now I personally fall into the ladder camp Of course, you guys know that But I think most people fall into the former camp and that's why there's always this tug-of-war going on where you see a lot of you know etherians a lot of a theorem og's kind of like bestow the virtues of why we care about decentralization why we care about building a Theory I'm the right way or at least what we believe to be the right way and why we won't compromise on our values and our principles just for short term kind of relief such as you know compromising on decentralization for short term scale at layer one that Angers a lot of people that gives opportunity to competitors That means that bad narratives flow and we've seen it all play out this year in 2021 It's been the year of bad narratives for a theorem based on this But I'm pretty happy that the etherian ecosystem hasn't caved to this even though we may have lost, you know Users in the short to medium term because if these were too high even though We may have been losing the narrative war for a little bit I do believe that the that the pendulum is going to swing back once we have these in one more scalable L Sorry These L twos kind of like more more developed and more integrated with different things and also that they have tokens and that's why I think this this tweet from super fees where he says a theorem can be less about money more about humanity is so important because without those people who actually care about building this technology the right way we would never get to experience something like a theorem because What would happen is a theorem would give up on its decentralization just say okay. Well, no one cares about it Let's just centralize everything will just become this data center chain and it'll be it'll be fine We'll have low fees users will be able to enjoy it and all the bad narratives will go away and everyone would love a theory Um, but that would be giving up so much like so so much I would personally leave the etheric ecosystem if that happened and there are many other people out there who would as well I literally like I would not even Think twice about if a theorem gave up on its values and its mission and what it's trying to build I'd be out and I you know, I'd look for something else But I haven't seen anything else that kind of like he's trying to do what a theorem is trying to do And I think that he's lost on a lot of people. I think those kind of like Those nuances those things that people like me are around They're in this ecosystem for I completely lost on the newer people because they just here for the money which is fine There's nothing wrong with that But that's why there's always these kind of like holy wars going on these narrative wars going on because you have two conflicting Interests you have the profit maximalist and then you have the ideologist and they don't see eye to eye on many things the profit maximalist Don't care about this sort of stuff at least not as a primary objective Whereas the ideologists don't care about being a profit maximalist at least not as a primary objective Maybe their secondary objective is money Which I think it is like I'm not saying that there aren't people who care about the technology and can also be a profit Maximalist or can also make a lot of money investing in these ecosystems But I think that the the people that create or work on the infrastructure work on a theorem work on everything or to do with Ethereum basically make a fear and what it is like it's all humans guys It literally it doesn't matter if these things can run autonomously like as dows It's still humans at the end of the day humans decide what happens humans decide what code goes into a theorem Humans decide what full notes to run humans decide what rules to follow it is not an AI that decides this for us We are not at the mercy of the Ethereum Network The Ethereum Network is at the mercy of its it's considered not maybe not its constituents And that's the wrong word but of the people involved with it So and if those people turn out to be all profit maximalist while the chain is going to reflect that the chain is not going To be what we what aren't the people the ideologies wanted to be so yeah anyway I thought this was a great tweet from from super fears Just wanted to expand in a little bit there And there's one more tweet from sundip that I wanted to talk about and it's a very basic one He said ETH equals web 3 web 3 is greater than Bitcoin hence dot dot dot dot hence ETH is greater than Bitcoin this basically talks to something that I spoken about before where I've Said that if theorems total just bull market or the total just bull market of web 3 is much much bigger than Bitcoin I actually find it so hilarious how Bitcoin isn't even the call in the conversation anymore No one I know talks about Bitcoin anymore, and maybe that's because I don't really follow any Bitcoiners But I think that even the people that I follow who are not you know hardcore theorems or anything like that They're kind of like neutral They don't even talk about Bitcoin anymore, and it's because it's not anything going on in Bitcoin like their biggest upgrade in like four years Was taproot and that wasn't even anything important like it didn't actually do much And they tried to oversell it they tried to sell it as something that it wasn't and a lot of people caught on that people Said well, this isn't actually bringing any benefit, so why would I care about this? And whereas a theory. I'm like it's always being talked about good or bad It's always being talked about every single day obviously like my fault You know people I'm following on Twitter are gonna talk about aetherium But even outside of that people hating on aetherium are still talking about it, so I just find that funny But I think that was you know front This is just a great tweet from Sunday because web 3 is basically you know the biggest total adjustable market if theorem has You know very large presence within web 3 you know the largest presence out of anything going on right now And you know that means that aetherium is going to be what's being talked about and Bitcoin really isn't it's going to be the niche Asset digital goal that they wanted it to be he's definitely not going to be the thing that most people even know about I believe Long term in terms of like paying attention to so yeah great tweet from Sunday Yeah, but I think that's going to be it for today I'm you know I think I made it to almost half an hour here even though I only had four tabs open there We'll see how the rest of the week goes I'll keep doing the refills But it may turn into me just ranting about things or doing educational rants because I don't expect there to be any major news this Week as I mentioned I think everyone's waiting for the January period to start for q1 to do those major releases because they know most People are just kind of like offline right now I've actually been spending a lot less time on my computer lately with the move and everything but also because I don't have proper home Incident I'm using my phone's hotspot. Which is so unreliable actually Don't like using my computer at the moment because I can't do what I usually do But anyway enough about my life story there. I think that's gonna be it so thank you everyone for listening and watching Be sure to subscribe to the YouTube channel if you haven't yet give it a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the disco channel And I'll catch you all tomorrow Thanks, everyone

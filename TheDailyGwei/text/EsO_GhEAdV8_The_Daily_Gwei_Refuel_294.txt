 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Daily Way Refuel Worry capital latest news near theorem ecosystem I'm your host the Anthony De Sarno and today's the 17th of January 2022. Alright everyone, let's get into it So ETH had its first deflationary week I believe so a hundred percent issuance offset as you can see in the ultrasound money screenshot here Which means that we offsetted all of the issuance from mining with ETH burning. Whoa, that's crazy That's really really crazy I mean, you know, I remember like people talking about a IP 1559 before it went live and saying oh, you know We're not gonna really have a deflationary period until the merge happens because it's just too much issuance from mining And then we started having you know deflationary hours deflationary days and now we've had a full deflationary week Which I believe it is the first deflationary week. Maybe I'm wrong here Maybe there was another one, but um, I don't remember it, but maybe I'm miss remembering there, but still it's super crazy I mean we burned over a hundred thousand ETH in the last seven days Which is what three engines its current prices? I think that's a hundred and sixty million dollars or something like that Which averages out to about fifty one million dollars per day over the last seven days of a being burned That's just absolutely crazy. Like the fact that I mean when you really kind of like contextualize those numbers I mean if we kept that up, which I don't think we're gonna keep that up, obviously Oh, you know for the next few weeks it kind of like it's volatile, right? It comes and goes but the thing is we are burning billions of dollars worth of kind of like eight a month, right? Which is absolutely just crazy and I think that right now the price is in kind of like this position where I Think what's happening? Is that like we're not really having any new people come into the ecosystem at least not in into kind of like the arm I guess like speculative ecosystem outside of NFTs I think a lot of new people are coming in through NFTs and stuff like that But they're more so kind of like investing in NFTs and not investing in you know ETH BTC other kind of like assets out there and the assets that you do see having kind of like great performance I think it's just people rotating from other things. So I was thinking about this today and I'm like, okay Well, what's it gonna take for like eats price to kind of like go up from here? I think that it's just a time thing right because when you think about it We're still continuously burning this You know this incredible amount of ETH and the Ethereum network basically acts as a demand kind of like driver It's basically buying 51 million dollars worth of ETH a day over the last seven days and not just buying it but permanently Burning it which means that it's essentially the same thing as like you're I buying that much ETH and just locking it up and never Selling it but I mean there's an even stronger guarantee here because it's verifiably burnt It cannot be sold or cannot be put back into the market ever again Now what happens when this you know new people start coming in again people start buying anything kind of like droves again And we have like that natural kind of I guess some Kind of like bid on ETH instead of kind of like these are these other things I think eats price can move very very quickly and can get rerated very quickly now I think this is gonna happen leading up to the merge I really do believe that that's gonna be an absolutely massive catalyst for people to kind of like just rotate back into To ETH and it's not just the rotators But a lot of people who kind of like realize that massive issue introduction is coming with the merge and the fact that we've had You know one five five nine burning all this ETH but I really do think that ETH price can move very very quickly in that scenario because of the fact that we've taken so much of the supply already off the market with one five five nine with a Locked in DeFi with staking as well and the price in the short to medium term is gonna do what it's gonna do But I think you know if you kind of like you know wait it out over the long term It's going to explode. You know if you actually go back and kind of like look at the way Prices move for different kind of crypto assets They tend to do a lot of their positive price movement in a really short period of time And then they'll have like long cooling off periods whether that's kind of like continuously going down or just going sideways You're relatively sideways for a while They'll just you know and those kind of like things if it kind of like go sideways for a while and then breaks back up again It's called a called basically a distribution zone where or a kind of like a reaccumulation zone where essentially you have the people kind of like Accumulating the people selling that kind of like are taking profits or just kind of like bulk get bored with the asset And then eventually it hits a point where it just starts going up again, and you know the perfect example of this is something like 2019 where each range from one to three hundred dollars for most of the year and then we got into 2020 and the price like Going up and obviously came back down with March But then went back up again, and he finally broke out of that kind of like range proper properly I think in July or August or something so you can think about it for like a year and a half It was in this this kind of like range and then when it broke up it broke up very violently We know from mid 2020 to mid 2021 or even I think even less than that eighth went from 300 bucks to four and a half thousand dollars almost one half thousand dollars So you can see how the positive price movement happens very very quickly after that sideways kind of like Range is kind of like broken there. I think the same thing's happening right now with eighth It's kind of like you know just crabbing as I like to call it And I think eventually you know we break out again And we kind of go to new highs go to 10k and beyond very easily And all these kind of like stuff like one five five nine staking all that stuff is additive to this so yeah anyway I know I'm preaching to the choir here But just a bit of commentary on What I've been thinking about lately because I know a lot of people kind of like say oh Ethan BTC are so boring to hold Because they're just not doing anything and all these other things doing things like that's totally fair I mean there's always going to be a market in crypto That's doing something right whether that be a defile defi 2.0 or some Ponzi or maybe The NFTs or some social token thing there's always going to be stuff that happens, but as I've said to you guys before I would never put a hundred percent of my portfolio into any of those things You know if I'm going to gamble and play around with them I'll put a small part of it into it But I've got my perm eight stack that I'm just kind of like never selling and it's just sitting there Well not sitting there. It's most of its taking of course, but You know and then I stack more you to kind of like get more validate Which I'm sure a lot of you guys are trying to do as well But anyway gonna leave it at that got a few upgrade updates to get through around actually No a couple around kind of like a theorem called protocol development firstly the update around the merge So here's a picture of go with your em a lighthouse and a lighthouse kintsugi node with five validators running on the same Raspberry Pi this is cool I mean This is an ethereum full node and a lighthouse full node running on a raspberry pi from what I can kind of see here I'm testing kind of the The merge now a theorem on arm this Twitter accounts a great follow They do a lot of stuff with kind of like low power low power devices like the Raspberry Pi And running these sorts of things and when this really kind of like is putting the bed the FUD Around the fact that all you need like should be if you hide where to run a theory I'm kind of like no roots and validators you don't you know The funny thing is is that the Bitcoin maximalists always went on about this with a theory like oh you need like super expensive hard But you can't run an ethereum full node on a consumer PC or laptop or anything like that I mean and we out when in reality you could and I did it a lot of people I know did it and then you Know it was just objectively false And then you have some of these other chains that where it's literally the literally true for them Well, you can't actually run right on a consumer kind of like piece So you have to have like some super beefy hardware in a data center or something like that And it's just funny how kind of like the Bitcoin maximalists would criticize ethereum for it But then they seem to be embracing these other chains I don't know. It's just a weird thing there, but really cool to see this from a theorem on arm here and Basically a rather kind of like site that I wanted to highlight for you guys Which has got to do with client diversity is from Ryan Berkman's here He's created a site called slash to dot info which basically shows How much extra if you lose by running a majority client during a worst-case slashing event? So TLDR is that you'll lose five times more eighth on prism versus Nimbus You can see the website here kind of like see how it's highlighting everything So, I mean, I think this number is a bit high on prism. He has seventy two point eight percent It was sixty seven percent or sixty eight percent from Michael Sproul's analysis But I guess like it's not too much of a difference there But the point is is that during kind of like a worst-case slashing event I guess like that would be kind of like a network wide slashing event If you're running the majority client, you're going to lose more money than running one of the minority clients It's just that's how the protocol works So again, this is another reason to switch from prism to something else or always switch from the majority clients or minority clients Because you stand to lose in case of that one of those kind of like slashing There's major slashing events and I went through kind of like last week about the different things got to do with client diversity and how It's really important And I think there's progress being made on contacting big kind of like staking parties like centralized exchanges and stuff like that in order to Get them to switch but yeah, this is gonna be an effort guys Like I know that even if you tell people this they're gonna a lot of people gonna be like, oh, okay Well, you know, I don't think it's gonna be a mass slashing event. Sorry. I'm not gonna bother or worry too much I do think post merge and so I should not say post merge. I should say post withdrawal is being enabled after the merge we're gonna see a better distribution just generally because people will be able to Much easier kind of like exit and then re-enter and without having to risk basically getting slashed or anything like that by double signing and You know, I'm gonna be curious to see how that plays out but this is how it exists today guys, like if you if there is a mass slashing event and you're on prism you're going to lose a A very a large chunk of your kind of like 8 compared to someone else. So definitely something to keep in mind here So arbitrum has been having a really big floss few weeks and I've been talking about them lately on the refill a lot But they crossed over three billion dollars locked today on their network. That's crazy This is just one L2 on aetherium crossing over three billion dollars locked altogether We have I think of the L2 is right now over six billion dollars locked Which is kind of like better than some of the out of the alt L ones out there And this is without native token incentives for most of these things, especially on arbitrum. There's no native token incentives I know that dope X has been doing a lot of great stuff on arbitrum They I think they account for a large chunk of this TVL and then you have things like magic and treasure NFT that I spoke about But I'm the fact that arbitrum is growing salt so organically without token incentives is really bullish to me Like I know I go on about the fact that eventually these things are gonna need tokens For both incentives and kind of like growing community and decentralizing and that sort of stuff But I've also said that the longer they can go without doing tokens while maintaining steady growth probably the better And it you know It gives them time to focus and not have to rush out a token and kind of like focus on on building this stuff out properly But I still expect as I said like most of these things to have tokens in the first half of this year if I'm wrong There I still expect it to happen sometime this year, but we'll have to see you know I'll have to see if they think it's necessary It may not be it may be that there's so much demand for these networks because they're so much cheaper than l1 that these These networks don't actually need native token incentives They can just have the projects do the token incentives to get people to come across as well Or people just naturally come across because it's cheaper for them to to do stuff on there. So very very cool to see this And again another update with arbitrum is that finance now has withdraws to the arbitrum one network enabled So I mentioned this a couple months ago or a month ago where they set where they enabled deposits But not withdrawals now you can withdraw to arbitrum now. I can't if I oh, yeah I think I know I did cover this last week, but this was the official tweet tweet from arbitrum I did cover this I think David me how I tweeted about this But yeah I mean there's an official guide now from arbitrum here that you can use as well And I think I discussed last week about the costs as well Like that I think was $10 to bridge in or something like that and how exchanges could subsidize that I think one major thing exchanges can do to subsidize those costs is that they could actually liquidity provide for these bridges like hop and connects and All these other bridges out there and kind of make up the difference there and in trading fees on their exchange with the fiat especially the fiat pairs because obviously Exchanges over time are going to lose a lot of their volume to decentralized exchanges But I think just you can't really do decentralized fiat trading and that's very very difficult And if you try to do that with any without any form of KYC you open yourselves up to kind of like very strict regulatory Punishment there. So yeah. Anyway, I do remember that I covered this last week But again, just starting out the kind of like guide here from arbitrum themselves Polina shared a reddit thread basically It's titled exploring the ecosystem to defy on the arbitrum roll-up so you can go check this out And you can kind of like see all the projects that are live on Arbitrums today that I've got to do with D Phi. There's a fair few now like look out That's a that's a pretty healthy ecosystem. They're still no popular money market yet like our VIF, right? Like we're still waiting on that as I've said, I think other v3 is very close to being done So they want to kind of like get on there, but there are other options for you right now Like you can see I mean there are other kind of like money markets and stuff like that But nothing like are there compound or maker? But yeah, I'm sure are there's gonna be live soon there, but definitely go check out this reddit personal link in the YouTube description To see what you can do on on arbitrum and there's also a list of bridges as well Like look at the look how many bridges there are guys like I remember I I've been speaking about bridges for a while now I remember there was only like a handful of them now. There's so many like looks synapse across any swap Sella connects hop Ren bridge orbit are leader fine. I mean there's so many out there There's gonna be more as we go on I think it's because people realize that the bridge space is incredibly lucrative or will be incredibly lucrative Because it's gonna be a lot of volume that flows through these bridges and a lot of um A lot of money to be made there. So really cool to see that And rari capital announced that they will be bringing fuse their fuse money market to arbitrum very soon So this is very cool As I said, like there's no big money markets just yet, but with are they going live and rari capital's fuse going live as well That's going to be really cool to see how that plays out, too So very big last few days for arbitrum really cool to see all the growth that's been happening of them for them there. So Speaking of bridges connects has a bridge a billion dollars worth of volume in just I think a year over their cross-chain network Now this is going to be a lot faster from here I think I think it was a slow burn at first because there you know a year ago There wasn't really much of a reason for most people to kind of like bridge to other chains or bridge between L2s I mean most of these L2s weren't live you really a year ago The only thing you were bridging to was BSC I believe and that was just kind of like at the very beginnings of that Now you bridge to all these other L1 L tail ones you bridge to these side chains you bridge to the L2s There's so many things to bridge to in and out of and these kind of like things are becoming incredibly these Sorry, these bridges are becoming incredibly important So I think the next billion for connects is going to be much faster than the previous billion, you know And it's gonna get to a point where these bridges are going to be doing potentially billions of dollars of volume a day right across aggregate probably and then Eventually tens of billions and I mean as I said like I've been very very bullish on these on these bridges and cross-chain swapping protocols for obvious reasons But I think that some it did take a while to get here because they actually needed to be things to bridge in and out Of but now that that's here. It's gonna be exponential growth from from here, I believe So polygon put together a little thread on some updates about polygon Midan So what's been happening there? So they've been having some advancements with new features in the upcoming version of mine and VM You can see here and you can go here. There's a hack MD page to learn more about it. This is a very low level stuff It's definitely not high level kind of like user facing stuff But I think it's cool that they're actually giving updates like this because at the end of the day as I said before a lot of these zk stuff is very in the weeds end users are really only going to get the benefit out of them once these things Alive and have apps on them something, you know, sort of like what Stark nets doing Whereas these sorts of things are good to put out there to kind of like get more developers involved with it as well because obviously The developers make the make the ecosystem and we need to get developers up to speed on on the CK technology So they can kind of better take advantage of it and kind of like better build Their apps on here because obviously it's very easy for them to port their existing apps to like EVM compatible roll-ups and L 1s and EVM equivalent L 1s and roll-ups as well But the zk stuff until we have like a zk VM and even then it may prove more difficult So getting these developers up to speed is definitely the priority here So cool to see these up there this mini update update thread from polygon Midan so speaking of polygon eth global announced that There's a kind of like I guess initiative called the road to web 3 happening from February 3rd to February 8th Which is powered by polygon So if you join this you'll be joining to build your first web 3 application Win thousands in prizes and meet new friends from around the world and learn from the best so you can apply now at web 3 dot e global comm if you're an aspiring kind of developer want to get involved with the web 3 polygon ethereum ecosystems I couldn't think of a better thing than this. I mean as I've said to you guys before I've judged A fair few 8th global kind of like hackathons the global has been around for quite a while They probably run the best hackathons out of the entire industry to be honest I can't think of anyone else that runs better hackathons than a global I mean there is a Denver which I don't think is an e global thing anymore I think they spun out of it or at least have never been an e global thing and that's obviously a very big in person In person a hackathon, but if global specializes in online hackathons And they do really well there because it it I think the online ones are more inclusive because The in-person ones you have to be able to get there right you have to be able to fly there unless someone sponsors you it's kind of hard if you're a you know if you're if you're in a kind of like a third world country or you're Kind of like um kind of for to go Whereas the online stuff you only need your existing kind of like hardware to play around with that like a lot of people already have Like a laptop or somewhere they can access a PC or even a even a phone like I'm sure there's some people out there that Really want to develop things, but they only have a mobile phone And then they use their phone to kind of like get started with this sort of stuff It'd be a lot harder to do that But I'm sure there's some people out there doing this or learning kind of like how to do this so so yeah if you're if You're interested in this definitely go to web3.ethglobal.com to check this out So we have an update from nifty island their closed alpha begins 17th of February 2022 which is a month from today, so I'm very much looking forward to this I've been talking about nifty island for quite a while I not an investor in them or anything, but I do hold a few of their kind of like items I hold the neon palm which was gifted to me I have the I have the neon pistols, and I also have the physical sword which is behind me But you can't see it It's like over there the physical kind of like nifty sword so I'm like fully Invested in their ecosystem, and I'm very much looking forward to for their closed alpha to go live I can't wait to build up my own little island and just kind of like have everything there I want to see if I can have some like figurines there and things like that have my neon palm and have some way for People to kind of like join me in the metaverse essentially right and like maybe have some deadly gray meetups there And maybe we have the AMA there which the AMA is coming back by the way guys I just still do not have proper home internet So I don't want to do the AMA and then my internet just keep cutting out and just ruin the whole thing so Hopefully sometime this week if not next week, but I'll keep you guys up to date on that one But yeah, you can go watch this cinematic trailer here I the sounds not on obviously, but I'm just letting it run in the background I'll link this in the YouTube description just very much looking forward to this. I think the metaverse stuff Right now still very very early, but these things like nifty island and other kind of like products out there I like the stepping stones to get us to a place where you know we actually do spend time in the metaverse and Build stuff and have cool products and services in there get together with our friends all that sort of stuff right and especially Things that are not owned by Facebook that a community aren't like I have no interest in being a part of Zucks Metaverse like at all like I can't think of anything worse to be honest So definitely not gonna not gonna be participating in that, but I will be checking out all the web3 crypto Metaverse kind of like games and stuff out there, and then there's a few that exist already But as I said all this is very very early stage But we're gonna get to a stage where it you know as I said It's gonna become like a commonplace thing for people to kind of like go in and join in and collect the metaverse join their Friends have meetups and things like that and it's gonna be super exciting there And you know the funny thing is on the topic of the metaverse stuff There's been a lot of cringe stuff lately like Walmart announced that that you'd be able to shop in the metaverse or like there was Some grocery chain that I think did it as well or something like that. I saw a video About it. I do believe it was Walmart, and I looked at that, and I'm just like this is so This is so corporate like I don't want to like I'm not gonna go in there in any kind of like out the Walmart metaverse Just to do some bloody it to do some online shopping I I don't see the point in doing that right like maybe you can kind of like I guess physically measure the The the size of certain products you're buying and things like that and maybe it gives you a bit better of an experience Especially be things like furniture. I can see that maybe but grocery shopping I don't need to walk through a store in like with my virtual reality kind of like um headset on to pick out items like If I'm gonna do online grocery shopping I'm just gonna go through a list and pick out what I want I don't need to kind of like physically hold the item in my hand or not even physically like Virtually hold the item in my hand to decide what I want, but that's just me I don't know how it is for you guys and maybe the younger generation Because they don't kind of like they spend so much time online so much time inside inside They probably will use that as kind of like a way to have some sense of Normalcy and kind of like oh, I'm at a grocery store, but you're not really but you are kind of thing I don't know how the future is gonna shake out there, but I can see that kind of becoming a thing But I think that with with the metaverse with all things crypto related It has to be a bottoms-up approach top-down approaches. Just don't work in crypto at least in web3 I think top-down approaches work for institutions that don't try to Be decentralized or try to act like they're decentralized just things like centralized exchanges It works very well for them, but I think if you're trying to be decentralized community-owned project Then a top-down approach is just not going to work and what I mean by this is like a top-down approach is essentially your traditional Hierarchy we have like a CEO and you have like executives and you have all the report the direct reports and things like that Managers and all those sorts of things Bottoms up. It's kind of like a flat org where you don't have a CEO You do have some semblance of leadership, right? Because obviously if there's no leadership then there's a leadership void and that usually gets filled by people that shouldn't even be in the positions of leadership or It doesn't get filled at all and everyone's just like kind of running around with their head chopped off essentially But essentially a bottoms-up approach is all these kind of like things happening No one telling you what kind of like what to do? No one I mean you do have like a kind of like soft road map of things you want to build But you don't have kind of like this micromanagement going on. You don't have CEOs and executives and all that sort of stuff It's really kind of like a grassroots movement. Um Or by people for the people sort of thing So I think if you're trying to be a truly decentralized web3 crypto product, you have to do it that way I don't think top-down approaches work at least they there are some times that it can work but I think for the most part it's just not gonna work and You'll get forked as well if you feel too corporate as we've seen before people will fork your project and basically say hey We're forking it We're giving most of the kind of like ownership away to the community because you guys are too VC heavy or you guys are too insider heavy and I think that's gonna happen more with metaverse projects than it will with defi projects because There's a sense of kind of like identity attached to metaverse projects And if you feel like your identity is stuck in like a corporate bizarro world that you don't want to be in Then they're switching costs. Of course a very low to go to another product, but you might decide hey, I'm gonna fork this I'm gonna make it less kind of like corporate and suits and I'm gonna make it basically For the people by the people and then you might get some some kind of like traction there But yeah, those are just my general thoughts on the metaverse I know everyone has their own thoughts on these these days and it's kind of like hard to tell where exactly it's gonna go But I do think it's gonna be a thing I do think there's gonna be both top and bottom top-down approach and bottoms-up approach I do think it's going to become corporate versus kind of like grassroots. It's definitely gonna become like Facebook metaverse of Walmart metaverse versus kind of like web3 native metaverse and I do think that the web3 native stuff will win just Like the open internet one, but we have to be very careful there, too Because the open internet one, but then we remanopolize the internet or at least we monopolize the internet Around a few select kind of like apps right like the the big social media Giants and a few kind of like other ones out there Whereas I think with web3 we do have a definite opportunity to not do that And I'm hoping that we can kind of like keep it that way, but we'll have to see how that all shakes out there All right. So final update from Zappa So Friday on Friday Zappa shipped their new collections page So this new feature gives you quick access to collection stats stats Such as floor price and a quick view of NFTs you own within that collection and they're teasing more amazing NFT features to come soon so you can see here They've got like a teaser or at least a band image of kind of like the doodles NFT collection here Which are really awesome, by the way, I mean I didn't see them until they started kind of like Blowing up and and then I saw them I was like, oh like the floor was like I think it was like 10th Or something when I saw them maybe I don't know I think was like seven or eight eighth and I'm like, uh, nah I'll be alright. I'll be right for now Because it just like I just you know Even it's too expensive for me and and then I kind of looked at them like these are really cool and I hadn't seen them Before and it's just funny how kind of like they came out They seem to have come out of nowhere, but there was a big community behind them But anyway, that's a bit of a tangent there. I just based on the screenshot that Zappa has here But I think this is cool. Like I think they teased NFT integrations a little while back You know and which makes sense because that was trying to be kind of like your home for web thrill the front page for web 3 so for them to have NFT support is pretty critical. I think that once they do they're kind of like mobile Wallet app and things like that That's gonna be really cool as well because you're gonna be able to have your NFTs on your mobile phone There are obviously other kind of like apps out there that do this doing this already like rainbow and I'm sure Arjun is going to do that and Then then then then kind of like some others as well But yeah, I mean zap I mean you I use Zappa all the time Like I mean you guys know I'm an investor in Zappa as well But I before I was in the restaurants that I used them all the time because it's just such a great product I don't do much NFT stuff, but I still like seeing what I've got in my in my kind of like Zappa portfolio There's a funny thing like that. I don't do much NFT stuff there I was talking to some friends about this today and about how You remember how like I think was last week or the week before I talked about You know dgens versus boomers and how I feel like I've become pretty boomer when it comes to crypto because I don't do the dgen Stuff anymore. The NFT stuff is a funny little area. Maybe I'll talk about this for I got about four minutes left Maybe I'll talk about this the NFT stuffs a funny area because you do have a lot of the degeneracy Kind of kind of going on in the NFT ecosystem. I mean, I'm sure you guys saw that Irene Dow today where This woman was selling kind of like herself is of it as NFTs and it went crazy She made she's made a lot of money off it so far But you know, there's kind of like that sort of stuff but then there's also a Kind of like stuff that has long lasting power and communities form around there and they tried to kind of like build products and services Around that and projects around it But for me when it comes to NFT stuff, it's just very hard to pick those winners, right? Like it's very very hard to know what's gonna be a flash in the pan Versus what's going to be going to have long lasting value and I think the same is true for pretty much every sector but with NFTs to become so pronounced because I think with with NFTs people gonna get like very attached to their NFTs and then they kind of like go down with the ship if the project or if the kind of like The NFTs the hype just wears off and you know, the this has happened many times I think I think it happened like pretty brutally with at the end of the last NFT mania with thumb I think was mecha verse or something like that Everyone went crazy over this kind of like profile picture collection and then I'm pretty sure they dumped very very hard Um, like extremely hard after you know after mint and I kind of like after the initial mania wore off And this is true for a lot of these kind of like profile picture projects, but there are some massive winners I think cool cats and bored apes and crypto punks and doodles now They're just massive winners that have long-lasting communities and people really enjoy Collecting these things and getting together with people on discord or or anything else like that and kind of like collecting the rare ones and stuff So I do think some of these things will have staying power, but for me is just so hard to pick And I'm sure you guys feel the same. There's just so much going on the NFT ecosystem It's just too hard and you know, I'm a collector of things obviously as you guys see all around me You guys know I collect my figurines, but that's a different kind of thing I'm not buying the figurines as an investment or kind of like as and they don't cost me, you know I mean most of them don't cost like 10 8th, right? This is crazy amounts for these kind of like that. None of them cost 10 8th Actually, that's like over 30 grand. Um, but it's just got crazy amounts of money for these things once they get very popular and that's why you see like so many of these things keep getting created because It was crypto punks and then people got priced out of crypto punks very very quickly Then bored ace came along and people got priced out of that Then there was like pudgy penguins and cool cats people get priced out of that and then you kind of like go down the list And people keep creating these profile picture NFTs to appeal to kind of new sets of people and new wealth levels, but NFTs obviously go far beyond that But that's when it starts getting even more kind of like out of my you know field of expertise I know nothing about art. I wouldn't know what's you know, good art from bad art or any of that sort of stuff And then you kind of like have NFTs like ENS names and things like that which people do speculate on That's kind of a different thing. It hasn't really got to do with like art or kind of like Profile picture NFTs or anything like that. It's just in ENS names and then you have crypto gaming in general Which is just exploding like play to earn all this sort of stuff. No idea So I think it's a full-time job You know of itself to kind of keep up with this sort of stuff to actually make money from it as well without getting lucky To actually kind of like play it strategically Definitely very difficult and even the top NFT kind of people in this ecosystem of inundated and probably looking for interns and things like that So just crazy when we think about it, and it's crazy. How NFTs really only blew up over the last What yeah, I would say last 12 months It really hasn't been much longer than that in terms of like really blowing up and going mainstream And it's amazing to me that even if the general market is quiet Even if Ethan be Bitcoin are doing nothing the NFT ecosystem is still going crazy So so yeah, anyway, just to my some of my thoughts on NFTs there.

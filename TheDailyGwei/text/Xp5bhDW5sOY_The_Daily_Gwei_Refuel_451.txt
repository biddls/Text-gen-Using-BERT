 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the deadly grave refuel where we cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host dan and he's a signer on tesla 20th of september 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So the sec Has charged or the sec has charged ian belina for promoting unregistered icos now for those of you who are around during 2017 and 2018 ian belina was Pretty popular had a pretty big following and had this kind of spreadsheet with all these icos listed in them That he would promote on his youtube channel on his twitter and everything like that And he wouldn't I mean I don't think most of the time he would disclose that he was getting kickbacks for promoting this he was Getting tokens paid out to him and things like that so all around just a bit of a grifter Probably you know pretty much as like a scam I if I had to if I had to go that far But the sec has finally gone after him and a chart is charging him with promoting unregistered icos Yeah, so you know I put out a tweet where I said you know finally this happened And then this is what the sec should be doing going after actual bad actors in crypto and not going after the honest builders But then James hancock here replied and said there is a kind of a point in the filing that said that I guess kind Of makes a weird argument. I'll read it out, so it says the us-based investors in Bolinas pool irrevocably committed to the transaction when from within the United States They sent their eat contributions to Bolinas pool at that point their eat contributions were validated by a network of nodes on the ethereum blockchain Which are clustered more densely in the United States than any other country as a result those transactions took place in the United States? So this is really weird and bizarre and doesn't make any sense because essentially what the sec is saying here Is that the sec has complete dominion over the ethereum network right and all ethereum? network transactions Happen in the us now obviously that's not true obviously that's not how this network works and also less than 50% of the nodes Are actually based in the us so he's not even right about that all the ssc isn't even right about that But this is a very dangerous thing like if this actually becomes Precedent and this actually is part of the filing and actually goes forward and become and goes into the records They can use this in the future if they wanted to this is a massive power grab right here We're just just this statement and they've buried it as number like 69 here on the point that they have in the filing Which is obviously very far down the list, but yeah, it basically states if I'm reading it correctly which I think I am That the sec believes that as long as you make you're making a transaction on the ethereum network You are basically transacting using United State infrastructure That's located in the United States and in the end all ethereum transactions happen within the United States which obviously isn't correct I as I said, I think this is insane I Really hate this because the fact of the matter is as I said I like the fact that the SEC is actually going after The people that they should be going after but then they're trying to shoehorn this crap into it Which just is kind of like I said, you know like rugged but again by the SEC, which is just ridiculous I think just generally and I've talked about it a lot Gary Gensler and the SEC they're trying to power grab wherever they can They're a lot of bark with very little bite though, and I was talking about this in the discord channel today But it seems like from my reading that ripple and the SEC are not ripple labs I should say and the SEC are not actually going to go to court They're going to settle out of court and it's probably going to happen relatively soon Now if I had to give my own assumption of what would happen here I think that ripple is labs is my or is probably going to admit that at the time that they sold and created XRP it was a security But it is no longer a security and they're gonna pay a fine for that initial Unregistered securities offering and they're not gonna admit any wrongdoing right basically the EOS treatment because this is what happened with EOS Now if the SEC can't even get ripple right can't even get XRP Which in my mind is one of the most obvious? Securities in crypto if you were to make an argument that a crypto is a security I would say XR piece is pretty obviously one Then how is the SEC gonna get anything else especially eat like people are always talking about all you know There's a risk that eats gonna be labeled a security because of comments from Gary Gensler and the SEC generally and as I said They just seem to have a lot of bark and very little by they seem to be trying to power grab But they seem to be failing it actually using any of the power that they seemingly think they have So it's just bizarre when I kind of look at that and look at people's arguments And and and really is just disappointing that the SEC has become such a clown show because as much as I don't really Think that financial regulations. I mean I'm against a lot of different financial regulations I still think that there should be a body that holds people responsible if they're literally scamming people or committing fraud like obviously I want criminals to be punished right but I don't want the the bodies that are responsible for punishing criminals making everyone feel like a criminal and making everyone feel like they Have to over comply like we saw with the o-fact sanctions for tornado cash right like everyone felt like they had to over comply on Things that's not good regulation. That's basically I mean, maybe the US or the nations they would consider that to be good regulation because they basically get I Guess like control over certain aspects of an industry for free. They don't have to legislate for it or anything like that And I actually on the ripple note as well I did want to make a note here The reason why I think that it's not going to go to court is because if the SEC was to lose that case in court It's even worse for them It basically sets a precedent Which means that if they lose there is probably zero percent chance that they'd ever be able to classify Anything as a security within crypto, which is obviously not what they want now. I'm not a legal expert So don't take my what I'm saying is gospel but from my understanding from my reading Like you only go to court if you think you're gonna win like in the legal system and the SEC obviously doesn't want to risk It at all ripple obviously has a lot of money to spend on lawyers and those lawyers are probably doing their job Right and as much as it pains me to say it. This is good for all of crypto Like I honestly think ripple and XRP are pretty much a scam and you know people flame me for that opinion Whatever. Maybe I'll get some reply guys on YouTube here But but generally them winning against the SEC will just defang of the SEC a lot and make it a lot harder for them to Go after other things not that I think that there was any risk that they'd be able to label it as security But just in general I think that as it currently stands the SEC is the biggest joke of an institution In the I guess like regulatory environment in the US they Gary Gensler needs to be fired. Essentially. He's not doing a good job at all I don't know how anyone could argue that he's doing a good job unless your definition of a good job is Is doing things that appease certain people over others. That's like I was venturing into a different discussion But yeah, this this latest filing is just ridiculous Like there's no way in how you can argue that every transaction happens on the ethereum network You know each jurisdiction of the SEC that doesn't work like that And then the fact that they're trying to push this Just shows that they are really trying to grab as much power as they can and I don't think they're going to succeed with that But yeah, that's that's all I wanted to talk about on that front on to some more I guess positive news from the last 24 hours so There's been a lot of discussion about Validated withdrawals or beacon chain withdrawals or staking withdrawals since the merge happened and for good reason I mean even before the merge happened. There was a lot of discussion around this for good reason We want to close that loop We want people to be able to exit from staking not just by selling off st Eth or re for example or any other LSD but also withdraw their eith from the beacon chain and also withdraw their rewards Right, they can only get the fees right now. They can't withdraw their block rewards We also want that too and there's been a bit of discussion About like whether this is going to be included in the next network upgrade Which is codenamed Shanghai and people have been doubting that it's going to be included. Well, I don't think so I mean as Preston van loon says here validated withdrawals are considered for inclusion in the Shanghai upgrade I believe this is an important feature that ought to be in the soonest practical upgrade and there has been a social contract in place For a long time now that withdrawals would come in this Shanghai upgrade or at least be highly considered to be included in that upgrade Which is obviously the first one after the merge and you can see here that the Specification for withdrawals is pretty much nearing completion and it's actually relatively simple to implement this It's not a difficult thing to do So once the spec is actually completed and finalized then the client developers can start implementing it and then from there Obviously we do the coordination dance We see what else we want to we want to want we want to do what other a IPS we want to include in The Shanghai update and then it goes live as I've said before I think that we could expect this in late q1 Probably q2 ish. I don't imagine it happening in early q1 because if you think about timelines here the next I guess like few weeks the core devs are gonna be I guess they still gonna be working on stuff in the background but not as much and then we've got devcon Which is obviously gonna take up a bunch of time in October then we're nearing the holiday period and things like that. So And it takes a while to get these things done. Like it's not something that can happen overnight So if I had to be generous, I would say late q1, but I'm more expecting a q2 kind of release here Which is still fine I mean that's in that six or twelve month window that people have been quoting and as I said withdrawals themselves are relatively simple and The decision could be made that we just ship withdrawals as its own hard for we don't have to put anything else into it We just do withdrawals and then if the other stuff isn't ready yet. We just do it in another hard fork later on Which I think would actually be the better way of doing things because as I've said plenty of times withdrawals are critical I believe that they should happen as soon as possible We shouldn't be delaying it which I haven't seen any indication of any delays or anything like that But I think that the core researchers developers people part of that environment Completely understand this and want it just as bad as everyone else wants it and III mean personally like I don't care Like people say oh, you know, it's gonna lead to a dump in price because all this eaters unlocking I mean that shouldn't determine what we put or don't put into the network It shouldn't have anything to do with markets as I've mentioned before and I don't think it will lead to much of a sell-off I think what's gonna happen is that great reshuffling I've been talking about multiple people have Signaled either publicly on Twitter or messaged me saying that they originally staked with a centralized provider because it was much easier Rockerpool wasn't live right a Lido wasn't even live and now they're like well, I want to actually exit that position But you know, maybe they staking with queen base They don't want to take the massive haircut on their eat that way They'd rather just wait But they really want to exit and there's also people who have stacked enough eat to become a solo staker that want to exit whoever they've staked with Previously and steak as a solo kind of steak are there So when you look at it like that You can see that it's not just going to be people are gonna withdraw their steak, which obviously goes into a queue It's not gonna all be withdrawn at once and just market dump their rate There's obviously going to be some of that people are gonna sell some rewards especially for tax purposes But generally I don't think that should dictate anything around withdrawals So yeah I'm very much looking forward to them going live and we can still expect them in the next upgrade Our next to hard fork such network upgrade that goes live on aetherium All right So speaking of staking a Marcio here from the rocker pool community put out a great thread today I started off by saying did you know that running an aetherium validator has a total of five revenue? Streams or seven if running with rocker pool, so he breaks them all down here by saying category one You have big in-chain rewards. Would you get rewarded for attestations for proposals and for sink committees? That's just the normal rewards that you will all see popping up If you're a solo validator you're running your own validator, you'll see those popping up a category two, which is execution rewards So this is new with the merge obviously tips, which is the unburned fear of a new and MEV Which is the minor extractable value or maximal extractable value that you can get from running things like MEV boost and category three is Rockerpool rewards. So there is Commission and RPL rewards as part of Rockerpool staking so you get even more rewards on top of solo staking I know people have talked about this a lot in the disco channel and I've talked about it on YouTube before But those are the kind of rewards that you get for staking on the beacon chain and it's very tempting to go with rocker pool right when you get those extra awards there and as I've Said previously I'm still in the process of spinning up my rocker pool Mini-pool and and getting all that out there and I think that those extra awards are very juicy for people and I think that they've done that obviously on purpose and in a very Targeted way in order to get people on board to to rocker pool because at the end of the day for me it goes like Ethereum solo staking in terms of I guess where I'd first take my eighth then it would be rocker pool And then after that, I mean it'd be kind of hard for me to choose I would have to say right now and probably lido Because after that it just gets pretty much every other solution from there's be centralized, right? There's just like it's always thinking then rocker pool then centralized solutions. So right now I'd pick lido just because they've been around for so long And then probably one of the best centralized solutions out there and then after that it just be centralized exchanges be coin Best or Kraken really so you can see we obviously need a lot more of these things coming online a lot more of these decentralized staking pools coming online But we still have a very robust one with rocker pool and a very great one which has a great community You know if you have any troubles you can go into discord channel ask in there They'll help you out and they're also still a very small part of the network So there's no risk of you. I guess like increasing their share of the network so much that it becomes toxic There's not none of that right there's still a very small percentage, and we obviously want to get them as high as we can But still under that threshold that I kind of mentioned yesterday of 10% now That was just a random threshold that I came up with you know in an ideal ideal world It would probably be less than that, but like there is kind of like those I guess Points that we don't want to see things out like 33% for example We don't want to see anything above 33% like at all like that is one of the key pivotal zones And obviously the worst case scenario would be any one entity or even a group of entities above 66% Because that's the finalization threshold, but if you think about it You know 10% or even like we're even maybe 15% on the on the higher end of things isn't extremely bad But it's still not great so under 10% is fine in terms of I think single entities on the network But we would need to work as hard as we can to get that even lower and not all entities are created equal either I think you can actually apply different percentages to different entities for example if 30% of the network was our solo staking I would have no issue with that right because solo staking is not just one monolithic entity It is I mean thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of different entities of different people in Individuals and things like that doing their own solo staking now obviously it's very hard to know how much of the network is an actual solo staker Because you don't want like the people who don't want to be found won't be found and fingerprinting them is quite difficult even if they Haven't hidden themselves But then things like centralized staking we don't want that anywhere near 30% right we don't want it anywhere near 20% We want it like 10% or less ideally and in an ideal ideal world it'd be 5% But then decentralized staking pools you can probably have that higher than 5% and pretty safely 10 15% might be fine, right? So I'm not meaning to imply that all of them are created equal there are definitely different thresholds But and obviously so I was taking is the gold standard in terms of thresholds But generally I think you know you just got to look at it as we don't want any one Party having anywhere close to 20 or 30 percent besides all those takers, but as I said so it's like as a hard to fingerprint That's why you see them listed as other in in I guess like those on Beacon chain charts that you see for stake distribution But even other doesn't necessarily mean solar sector could mean anything really, but it's just it's assumed that it's always take a right But yeah anyway enough on that topic. I've got a bunch of others the things to get through before I run out of time today So julio here posted another tweet thread or tweet about our verkle trees or the verge so julio says I just prototyped the verge transition at 8th Berlin on Aragon will fuzz it But I could not manage to break it manually so far you won't be able to be sinking from scratch for now But the switch happened flawlessly So the verge is one of those next I guess roadmap items that are going to be executed on over the coming years along with the surge and all those other ones that you've heard of And if you want to know all about the verge actually it is a perfect segue into a blog post Or I guess like a newsletter that Hamish put out today Which is part two of his after the merge sub stack series, which is all about the verge So this post explains what merkel trees and proofs are how verkle trees and proofs to prove upon them and the statelessness Implications are for full node, so I obviously highly recommend giving this Thing a read here But there's also a little teaser from juliam here who works as a core developer on geth at the ethereum foundation About the smell of new verkle testnet coming up soon, so the work is continuing on These I guess things these roadmap items after the merge not just on the surge related stuff like proto dang sharding But also on verkle trees which are very important But as I said I recommend you read this blog post slash newsletter To get the full lowdown of that and dive deeper into the verge because I think the verge is probably in terms of like near-term Ish roadmap items the verge is definitely there And it's probably the one of the most least understood more widely obviously when it comes to sharding and things like that and proto dang sharding I think that's that's better understood because it's been talked about longer But I'm gonna try my best to talk about the verge more and point you towards ways to get yourself educated Because it is definitely just as important For for the ethereum roadmap, that's why it's a major item on the roadmap, right? So go give these a read only kit in the YouTube description below But good to see both a go with your own developer or geth developer and an eragon developer working on Verkle trees here All right, so Varun from Stanford Yeah, actually he works on research at chapter one which is a crypto farm But he went to Stanford if they had Stanford University here I put out a thread saying zero knowledge proofs will revolutionize how we think about privacy and scaling Computation and they're just starting to take off don't want to get left behind. Here's a quick primer just for you So just another thread to check out To I guess like get the lowdown on zero knowledge proofs when it comes to privacy and scaling highly recommend the thread I mean even if you understand zero knowledge proofs, it's probably still worth the raid just to see if you're missing anything So I'll link that in the YouTube description below for you to check out and speaking of threads to check out There's another one here from Haim who is a recommended follow at this point I think he is doing he or she I don't know who they are I doing a lot of really great threads around Ethereum generally over the past few weeks and I've highlighted some of them on the refill already Well today's thread is all about Eigen layout Eigen layout and how to pronounce that exactly And about how it will extend a to provide generic extendable trust And I think Pauline has talked a lot about these guys before as well So you can definitely check out this thread for a lowdown on them. It's a 24 tweet thread So a bit longer than your usual thread, but not too long and obviously if you've been reading Haim's previous threads You'll know that this one's a goodie as well. So I'll link that in the YouTube description for you to check out All right some news out of Galleon today So following the passing of Galleon on improvement proposal 7 the carpenters have blistered their hands deploying upgrades So arbitrum cannons are on deck and optimism cannons are on deck and the set protocol fork is now deployed and the product roadmap is unlocked so a lot of updates here on the Galleon side of things as you can check out in this blog post so Arbitrum and optimism deployments are done. I believe here and there's also a little what's next section around What's coming up on the roadmap so you can check this out? I'll link in the neutral description below, but good to see another team Just building through the bear market like that's what it's all about right now And you guys know I'm an angel investor in Galleon as well, so I should just disclose that disclose that there But I'm an angel investor in them because Andrew Wilkinson here the founder of Galleon he Was it set and I have been friends with him for quite a while And he just knows what he's doing when it comes to Structured products and it comes to what people want within DeFi, and I think what he's building with Galleon is really awesome So you should definitely go check that out. I'll link it in the YouTube description below All right, so speaking of new deployments 0 X's API is now live on Arbitrum So if you're a developer you can now tap into 0 X API for aggregated liquidity and smart order routing with Bix best executed Prices deep liquidity 99.9 percent uptime and uber fast response time so you can check out this blog post for full details on this But obviously this is one for the developers out there But cool to see this is live on Arbitrum because developers will tap into this and then users will get I guess Value out of this 0 X integration on Arbitrum so all links in the YouTube description for the developers out there to check out so An announcement out of ENS today so ENS and coinbase have teamed up so aligned with Enns mission to make web3 more accessible we partnered with coinbase to create cbid Usernames are free to claim at web3 username existing dot etherdresses can connect existing names To seamlessly transact and build out your web3 digital identity So I think you might have seen these before the cbid I kind of identities that you can get through coinbase Which is running on ENS, so it's not a dot 8, but it's like a dot ID I believe so you can basically have like sassle dot ID instead of sassle dot 8 for example Which I think is really cool like obviously I would have preferred it to be dot 8 on the front end But it's still tied to the same address Because you can have like many of these things tied to the same address But dot ID I guess just makes sense from coinbase aside of things because coinbase wants to be relatively neutral probably towards these networks Even though I think that coinbase is doing a lot of great work for aetherium and it's a layer 2 ecosystem as well And they're doing a lot of really cool stuff in their coinbase wallet with the defi integrations I guess like it makes sense for them to do dot ID rather than a dot 8 on on their front end for their users So they can basically not confuse their users so to speak and then anyone wants to dive a bit deep I can just see okay well it's dot ether under the hood you know go get their dot ether name and things like that as well And play around on chain with defi too so very cool to see this partnership Just ENS kicking more goals here and coinbase doing some more great things within the ethereum community All right so a fresh blog post out of lee.fi today So this one is called navigating arbitrary messaging bridges a comparison framework so Bridges I haven't talked about them in a little while But they're still as important as ever and I just saw before and I forgot to include it that there was a critical Bug I believe in the arbitrum bridge after and it got introduced after nitro was deployed from L1 to L2 And as I've said to you guys before Just because a bridge is like an L2 bridge doesn't mean it's any more inherently secure than a cross-chain bridge Right like from a from a bug perspective from like a smart contract perspective There are a crypto economic designs and architectures that are more exploitable for cross-chain bridges than they are for the L2 stuff But this was a bug in the actual contract now as I've also said before The contracts are the L2s at the end of the day the bridge contract is basically the L2 because that's where all the assets are stored They're still stored on ethereum layer one you basically get this iou on layer two right So and and this thing that kind of represents what's on in that layer one bridge so I think with this exploit It was found and patched and everything by a white hack, but I think with this exploit What could have happened is that funds could have been drained out of the L1 bridge contract? Which would have left the funds on L2 without anything backing them and it would have led to a bit of chaos there Or maybe a lot of chaos So it's still very important to keep in mind that just because something is an L2 and you're bridging to an L2 Doesn't inherently make it more secure against bugs in the contract than if you were to bridge to a sidechain or another L1 Because at the end of the day you're putting money into a smart contract It's the same thing with like DeFi and other smart contracts out there You need to be aware that there's risks with that so that's why I think that I wanted to highlight this this blog post as well Which is actually quite a lengthy rate It's a 44 minute read But it's got a massive comparison framework over these arbitrary messaging bridges Which I think one of the more popular bridges out there are there's things like axilla layer zero nomad wormhole So no both nomad and wormhole have been hacked previously right with massive hacks I believe nomads was a hundred and ninety million wormhole was like 300 million or something And then there's other ones as well that I don't believe have been hacked yet Maybe they will in the future, but you should definitely give this post a read to understand How all these things work how they differ? You know what what kind of security assumptions there are and all those sorts of things as I said It is a long beefy read. I haven't read it yet It's just too long for me to fit in over the past couple of days or since it was published But I do plan to get to it. Hopefully maybe over the weekend when I've got some more time But I think it's definitely well worth the rate because I've read the blog post that they've put out before That Levi has been have been putting out before and they're usually very good So I'll link this in the YouTube description for you to check out All right, so a Liam here has a new newsletter called the layer 2 weekly roundup So this is going to be a weekly newsletter covering which covers the latest and most important updates from within a theorems layer 2 ecosystem So if you're interested in keeping up to date with layer twos, well, this is what you should be subscribed to It's just a bunch of I guess a collection of resources here with a bunch of dot points and updates all around L2's across the entire ecosystem and I think it's very very useful I think you know, I used to do this for I think like what set when I was doing like these weekly DeFi newsletters and it was basically just like a Roundup right where people could go in to find some resources go gets go get educated on things keep up to date with things I think these are very valuable So I'll link Liam's new newsletter in the YouTube description below and you can go give it a subscribe and also give Liam a follow He does a lot of great threads around layer twos and just a theorem in general Just a theorem in general definitely worthy follow. So I'll link that in the YouTube description as well for you All right, last up just a quick shout out that there's only a few days left in the current get coin grant around So you should definitely go donate to your favorite to get coin grants and one of those should be the protocol guild which refresher For you guys is a collective of 119 if you're in core protocol contributors and they're getting paid with oil donations So you'll be directly contributing to the future of the etherium core protocol by donating to the protocol guild But as I said, don't just donate to the protocol guild You can also donate to any of your favorite projects on a gitcoin for the last few days of this grants round Which actually finishes in a couple of days. Yeah the 22nd. I believe it finishes So it's a couple days from now to go do it. I don't think I've done it yet actually Yeah, well, I just remember I'm reminding myself. I've got to go do mine So I'm gonna go do that. But yeah, definitely go go do that But I think that's gonna be it for today. I just wanted to make a quick comment. Hopefully the audio issues are better I know in the past I've had a lot of issues around popping So whenever I said peas it would like really pop and it would get annoying and there was different like volume issues and things Like that. I changed my mic and like filled up fiddle with the whole setup and it seems to be a lot better now So if there are still issues, please let me know but I think I finally like ironed it all out So hopefully it's all good there. But on that note that's gonna be it for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet Give me a thumbs up subscribe to newsletter join the disco channel, and I'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone

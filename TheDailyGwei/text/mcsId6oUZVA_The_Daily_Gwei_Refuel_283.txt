 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the deadly way refuel where recap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host Anthony sasano and today's the 30th of December 2021 Alright everyone lets get into it. So today is gonna be a special episode of the refuel. I don't have any news in front of me It's just me on the camera and I mentioned yesterday that I'm going to be recapping the year of 2021 as this will be the last Refuel I do for this year. So we starting off by kind of like, you know Obviously starting from January of this year going all throughout this year I'm just gonna give my thoughts on what happened You know all the all the big things in the ethereum ecosystem But also in the crypto space more widely and also going into next year what I expect to happen as well So yeah, let's let's start from the beginning, you know, 2021 has been a funny year. I think overall really I think most people got things wrong like with their predictions. There are a lot of things that people thought Okay well this was gonna happen or this was gonna happen and it ended up being like completely wrong and I think one of the major things Of that was basically around the market everyone expected, you know, we'd have like a massive bull market all throughout 2021 We'd have a blow off top towards the end and then we'd go into a bear market again I mean, I don't think everyone expected that it's just like that was the consensus that I saw kind of play out in the In the Twitter sphere and and and and in other places as well So I guess in January 8 started off in a pretty weird place. I mean it was still $700 Like can you believe that I think on January 1st? 2021 8 was seven hundred and thirty dollars and only a few weeks prior to that It was it had been like 400 or something So nothing obviously to scoff at or sorry nothing to kind of like right home about of course But then it ended the month at $1400 almost all-time high there, which is crazy I mean, I'm pretty sure it did reach all-time high in January or it broke its old all-time high in January Which was like three years after it had done. I did broken the all-time high in January of 2018 So that was obviously a really big deal, but it's just funny like how quickly it moved I mean we came off 2020 where it was all about defi and all about kind of like Bitcoin because you know there was the institutions kind of piling into it and he's kind of like took a backseat and people like really bearish on eighth and then he's just kind of like teleported to its old all-time high in January and then obviously Over the next few months. They went into a crazy bull market and ended it, you know in May of 2021 ended up at $4,400 and then came back down To 1700 then went back up and you know, it's been crazy been like a yo-yo essentially and what the price is $3,700 right now or something like that $3,800 So it really has been just a massive kind of like yo-yo for the price But price obviously wasn't the only thing that happened in 2021 I think the other massive narrative that played out that I think a lot of people didn't see coming was the alternative L ones obviously There are a lot of people who thought that they would kind of like fail and that failed to get any traction That if theorem was fine that if you're in wood scale before any of these things could get traction and to be honest I was one of those people with layer 2 like I understand why it's taken longer than everyone kind of like thought it would but it definitely has you know the fact that it's taken longer has also given rise to these alternative L ones because they've kind of like Played with the narrative and the marketing of all you know, if you're in can't scale the fees are really high come use us We're cheap. But as I mentioned yesterday, I actually think that regardless of a theorems high fees these other L ones basically would have taken off because of the fact that they used the tried and Tested playbook of liquidity mining which came from 2020 where? Everyone kind of saw while people token incentives on something and you do it, right? You can get lots of liquidity really really quickly and it can lead to price rise for the asset For your kind of like native asset that's got to do with the project or the chain or whatever And it's really good marketing and even business development as well from that perspective So I think that playbook has kind of like been refined to be an art at this point where everyone's just basically copying everyone else And being like, okay. Well, this is you notice how we do it. This is how we grow and as I mentioned yesterday I think the L2 should be focusing on this going into 2022 But yeah That was a big theme of 2021 that Certainly most people didn't see playing out and I think it was because a lot of the people that were around Earlier this year and kind of like later last year They weren't new they were like people that have been around since the last bull market and they'd seen the other L ones and like How much how much traction they didn't get for example all of them all of them Basically, even the the biggest one like EOS from the 2017 2018 era Didn't go anywhere. And so I think there's a lot of hangover from now people like okay. Well, they failed There's nothing that you know, none of these L ones can succeed. It's all a theory I must just focus all our efforts there obviously, you know, I still believe that it's mostly a theorem, you know over the long term But these other L ones have really worked to kind of like capture the mind share of a certain group of certain communities Like especially as the asset goes up in price you really do build a community quite nicely because of that So that's that's one thing I think the second thing that most people didn't see your 2021 was NFTs they took off massively, right? Like we we're not we didn't only have like one NFT man. Yeah, we had many and they I think we're Kind of like going into one right now to be honest the NFT volumes are spiking up again It's just it really feels like the NFT market It seems to kind of like play a bull and bear market much much faster than the normal crypto markets Like you could argue that since May 8 has been it hasn't been in a bear market, but it's been in a sideways market, right? It's just kind of neutral. It's not really doing anything I mean it yes, it went to a new all-time high of 4900 But that wasn't really much higher than the old one and then it came back down again And we've just been in this range from like three thousand to five thousand form for a while now And you know as I mentioned plenty of times now I think January and Q1 is gonna be really really good for the overall market in general and for crypto But yes since May it just hasn't really done much in terms of like price price movement and you know I'm used to it as as I've been in this ecosystem for a long time now, but a lot of people out there See this sideways move and then they see all these other assets kind of pumping up and they're like, oh my god Why am I you know sitting in here that could be chasing these other things? That's a whole obviously different discussion that's got to do with you know How to how to make investments and how to do investing there But I think that the NFT mania is definitely something that most people didn't see coming I I knew NFTs were gonna be kind of like a big deal But no way did I think that they were going to be to grow as fast as they did And I also didn't see a lot of the FUD coming either like people legitimately think NFTs Scams like not the actual scammy NFTs. I think all NFTs are scams There was a lot of concern about the environmental impact of NFTs Some of the L1s like Tezos are hopped on about that and we're actually able to get a bit of traction in the NFT Ecosystem by doing that don't think it really helped their asset price too much though Which is which is funny when you kind of like compare Tezos to some of the other alternative L1s and how Kind of market treats them It's definitely a funny beast there, but they did succeed in getting a lot of people to go there who were Environmentally conscious because Tezos is obviously a proof of stake blockchain and not a proof of work one And then you know you had you had basically what happened with NFTs Reminded me of what happened with ICOs in 2017 where people were doing the kind of like gas wars in order to get into these And to these NFTs to get into the mint in order to immediately Resell it on the secondary market for like two three X or more profit. I mean sometimes it was much more than that There was some that kind of like went 10x instantly and it reminded me very much of ICOs in 2017 where people were doing the same thing they were having kind of like gas wars Getting into the ICO and then waiting for it to be listed on an exchange because there wasn't actually really any DEXs back there And there was no Uniswap or anything there was Ether Delta But that was an on-chain order book exchange that was really cumbersome to use it required people to kind of farm You know actively manage their liquidity and things like that So it was a lot harder, but still people did it right you would you would hope for a centralized exchange listing And then you could flip it and it worked for a little bit But then obviously the mania subsides the money runs out and you know the market kind of crashes from there and ICOs crashed Really really hard. I mean a lot of them went down 90% You know many of them went down 99% It's just a none of most of them haven't even recovered so you know pretty much like a lot of wasted money there really And I think the same thing happened with NFTs there were a lot of profile picture NFTs that kind of I guess like started coming out after the success of Crypto punks and bored apes and things like that and I think NFTs I mean I think it's been a good thing for NFTs that they've had these manias because it brings a lot more attention brings a lot More people into the ecosystem and as I've mentioned plenty of times I do believe NFTs are going to be the best onboarding vehicle or at least one of the best onboarding vehicles that we have throughout 2020 not 2022 But like pretty much throughout the adoption cycle of crypto now other than NFTs. I think the the next biggest theme if I was to pick one is basically how many people got things wrong because I think that's actually a theme because There were at this if you compare the start of the young people thought would help how 21 2021 would play out and get to kind of like where we are today Most people got it wrong And I think the biggest thing that people got wrong was around DeFi and how DeFi tokens would perform at the start of 2017 at 20 sorry 2017 at the start of 2021 Everyone was bullish on DeFi tokens except a select few I know I'm the Jen Spartans being kind of like bearish on them for a while But everyone was really really bullish on them that the logic was Okay, DeFi tokens had a really awesome run in 2020 through DeFi summer now They're cooling off a bit, but they're just getting ready for their next kind of like leg up all these Institutions and traditional finance investors are gonna come in They're gonna buy up these DeFi tokens and it's all gonna be well and good and then what happened was most DeFi tokens Not all of them, but most of them especially the ones people thought were safe kind of blue chips like are there? SNX and Wi-Fi and all that sort of stuff They got wrecked like absolutely wrecked against USD and they got even more wrecked against eighth. They've severely underperformed eight I think are there from the top is down 80% against eight or something crazy and I pick are there because that's you know Quote-unquote blue chip nothing to say of the project right the project is awesome Just the token price has suffered majorly across like all of these assets Not just are there but a lot of a lot of the different DeFi assets So that was definitely a big thing that people got wrong in in 2021 and you know people are betting now at 2022 DeFi is gonna kind of Have a renaissance and there's gonna be lots of people beating it up because there's just so undervalued I actually think that there will be some of that but it's gonna be very hard to pick a winner Because there's so many assets in crypto now not just on a theory on but on other blockchains That it just becomes so incredibly hard for an investor to kind of like put their money in something and have conviction on it Like for example, if you are completely new to crypto you come in you're like, okay Well, I want to invest in something and then you kind of how you're gonna evaluate that like what do you use? You like for traditional investors You typically use price to sales price to earnings Ratios which DeFi has a lot of you can go to token terminals website and you can actually see all the DeFi coins measured Against each other and then there's other things kind of like if you're a meme based investor Which a lot of people are these days thanks to Wall Street bets you would kind of like place a bet on What the what the thing is that you believe to be like have the best memes or kind of like have the best attention And we'll continue to have the best attention or the most attention going into 2022 But other than that, it's very very hard to pick something to invest in especially with all the information asymmetry that exists within crypto all the misinformation Or everyone's chilling their own bags everyone trying to justify things I mean the amount of things that people kind of like shield through 2021 that went nowhere because it's just like no one bought into it was crazy And speaking of kind of like a meme based investing I think another thing that in 2021 that played out was the dog tokens, right? not just the the dog tokens is the theme but really the the the rise of kind of like meme based investing wasn't just Sorry, it wasn't just kind of like limited to crypto it also happened in the traditional markets with with GME and kind of like a few other A few other stocks out there But then it translated into crypto with dogecoin and shiba and a few others out there like safemoon and stuff like that That stuff happens typically like late stage of a market and it basically preceded the massive dump in May That's because everyone felt like really rich There was a lot of funny money coming in people had stimulus checks all that sort of stuff there and that was all coming in And that lead to the led to this kind of like meme based Pumping going on in many different tokens. That was another big thing of of 2021 now I think I think that covers most things in terms of like the higher level themes. Maybe I'm forgetting things I think like Dow's have definitely come further in 2021 than than they were last year But they still got a long way to go social tokens had a little bit of attention But they've still got further to go. I think L2's was obviously a big theme actually How can I forget about L2's I think L2's was a huge theme of this year But only in probably the latter half of the year not so much the former half I think you know Albatrom going live optimism going live after saying that we're gonna go live in March and then delaying until like July when Uniswap v3 went live on optimism and then not removing their whitelist until like two ones or two weeks ago I think it was and then you had Albatrom going live too, but then like this and the zk stuff obviously You know slowly coming out and you know none of the kind of like L2's have done tokens yet or anything like that So it's been a bit of like a soft launch for these L2's But they've still been a big theme like I guess like scalability in general has been a huge theme for a theorem in 2021 It's been basically what everyone's been focused on due to the high gas fees and as I've said before I think 2022 is going to be a really good year for for layer 2. I think you know all these L2's are gonna get tokens I think they're gonna do much better and I think they're gonna be a really good year for L2 They're gonna do much better in the marketing and BD departments because of it and there's gonna be a lot more Opportunities to make money on there a lot more apps gonna get on board it onto there Which is gonna be really really cool to see it play out as well And I think related to that we also had the rise of polygon as you guys know I'm an advisor to polygon not just trying to show my bags here, but polygon POS chain Rose like really rapidly I mean it's funny because Maddy came from a position where it was known as this scaling thing But no one really knew what they did right until they rebranded to polygon They were working on plasma they've been around since like 2018 I believe or maybe even earlier than that and they rebranded the polygon they spun up this POS chain and it basically acted as a Nice, I mean people call it sidechain some people call it layer 2 But it basically a nice environment for people to go in and experience the EVM Without the high fees and that's what really kind of like kick-started all these other alternative L1's To to kind of like copy polygons playbook because they saw okay. Well they did liquidity mining They got all this kind of liquidity over and their token went absolutely bananas I mean, I think Maddox token price was something like 2 cents at the beginning of the year now It's like $2.50 so I think that L1's more so copied polygons playbook then DeFi summers playbook But I think DeFi someone's playbook kind of like set the stage in terms of liquidity mining and and all that sort of stuff For everything else to kind of like copy it from there And it works as a really good kind of like tool right because we've seen the rise of polygon and obviously Polygon has done a lot more than that. They don't actually have native matic rewards in any kind of like aggressive fashion anymore It's really just like their business development and in marketing and kind of like acquiring these other zk teams and stuff like that That has been really really good for them So that's that was another big theme of 2021 and I think if I had to kind of like summarize the whole year You know taking into account all these high-level themes taking into account the the price action what the markets done in 2021 I would say that 2021 was the year that crypto basically jumped the the chasm and we've jumped from basically this early stage nerdy technology that only a few people paid attention to To the early kind of like adopters going on to mass adoption, which isn't you know here yet? But we're basically in the early adopter phase where this technology went from being okay Well, maybe this will work out to okay, you know, this is gonna change the world. That's 2021 to me Doesn't matter how many things people got wrong how many things people got right? It doesn't matter about all the other themes that I spoke about What matters to me is like the overall kind of I think and the most important thing and that that that is the fact that We've kind of like not gone mainstream, but we've crossed over to the to a point of no return We're basically like crypto is going to succeed a lot of people believe that and there's no going back from there. So I Had a lot of fun this year. I actually think 2020 was a better year for me than 2021 I mean personally I think 2021 was a bit more of a come-down year for me especially in the second half where it was kind of like, okay, well, you know, I've I've come a long way in my journey within crypto I you know I made I made all this money from investing in eighth early on and then kind of like I Guess after 8th finished eating its all-time high and came back down. It's kind of felt like just I've been cruising, right? I've been kind of like doing the refill still doing the newsletter is still keeping up with everything happening in the ecosystem but I feel like we're in this kind of like holding pattern right now where it's kind of Getting ready for the next leg up from here. So and not just in the market but in terms of like adoption as well and it feels like so many things are Coming at once and 2022 is gonna be big I think and actually now that I think about it as well I just reminded myself Another big theme of 2021 not the overall theme but another big theme that I forgot to mention By the way, I'm doing this all off the cuff. I haven't actually got any notes prepared for this I'm literally just speaking as things come to me so apologies if I like repeat myself where I forget things but I'm just doing it because I I Feel like my videos are better when I just kind of like do it from stream of consciousness But the other big theme was regulation but there was the first time that crypto was on the kind of like world stage in terms of regulation and that was no more clearer than it was around the infrastructure bill that happened in the US where The crypto provisions were actually holding up the infrastructure bill from going forward and we made ourselves known we made our presence known and this falls into my my kind of like overall theme about how 2021 was the year that crypto kind of like put across the point of no return where we've gone Haven't gone mainstream, but we've gone into kind of like the early adopter phase. We've gone in, you know, we've gone geopolitical obviously Outside of the kind of like a theorem land. We had Bitcoin with El Salvador making it legal tender That was obviously a huge theme as well But that I think fits into kind of like the government regulation nation-state stuff that's been going on all year And there's been tons of regulatory talk. Obviously, they've been kind of like the SEC, you know yelling at people You know yelling at teams yelling at projects just doing their you know, the absolute worst job ever not protecting anyone And then you had like the the Congress kind of like debating the infrastructure bill and the crypto revisions holding it up So that's been a very very big theme in 2021 as well And I expect it to continue to be a big theme When you cross over the point of no return When you go from being a little plaything that people can just ignore to people realizing that this isn't going away This is actually going to be a big deal. It's going to disrupt industries. It's going to change the world you You definitely are met with force, right? You're met with kind of like Resistance from the incumbents and they are going to resist they're going to resist harder than what they are Now they're going to be countries around the world. That's not that they're probably won't ban crypto, but they're gonna come down hard on it They're gonna do things like ban you from or at least requiring KYC for you to withdraw crypto from an exchange to your address This was floated in the US didn't pass but I believe some other countries are in the process of implementing these policies That's all coming and that's why I've said before my two main kind of like Things that I'm most interested within the crypto ecosystem in terms of like investment opportunities, especially Layer two technologies and privacy technologies, but I'm not so bullish on privacy technologies such as like Zcash or Monero like standalone blockchains I'm more bullish on privacy tech that built on a blockchain like a smart contract blockchain like aetherium That is able to kind of like enhance the experience not be the sole product. I don't think I don't think the privacy blockchains are going to accrue any long-term value. You've already seen the price of ZEC It's just done nothing Monero. I'm not even sure it is, but I'm sure it hasn't done much either I think that there are privacy things you can invest in on aetherium There's there's an overlap between L2s and privacy as well as I've discussed before But I think that's going to become more and more prevalent as these regulations start ramping up Which unfortunately is the reality that we have to have to be met with I mean the internet went through this too Like you may think that a lot of the internet kind of like just was adopted by everyone the governments were happy with that And nothing, you know, nothing bad ever happened and nothing was ever kind of like banned or censored But that's couldn't be further from the truth. There was a lot of clamping down on what you could do with the internet I mean look at piracy for example, obviously, you know pirating copyright materials is is illegal, right? It's that you know, you're literally breaking the law if you're doing that But the way they went about regulating it was was kind of crazy They they literally started like banning these websites, even if the websites didn't host the content. They just kind of like pointed to it They would do that and then there was the whole net neutrality thing in the US and and and basically There's a lot of fun kind of like censorship going on as well And I mean craziness especially around when Trump was president on social media like people saying, you know How can he say this like this is ridiculous? Like it goes against your policies and social media didn't want to ban Obviously the ban the president things like that because of the repercussions So there's a lot of stuff that's going on with the internet as well and it's just natural for any technology That's it that allows people to do whatever they want with it. There's going to be pushback There's going to be heavier regulation than otherwise and there's going to be a lot of resistance So I think that's what I'm going to be looking for going into 2022 as well Is that level of kind of like resistance that we're going to be facing? Especially as rate regulations ramp up around the world not so much maybe the US because the US is a very big place They seem to be I guess like okay right now I think there's that we've got a few people in politics on our side at this point, which is which is cool to see But I think we're bribing the right people at this way. It's bribing. Sorry. Sorry I should say donating to the right people and lobbying right? I think I'm seeing that play out there But there's definitely gonna be a big theme going into 2022 which as I'm coming up on the 30-minute mark here I do want to segue into some of my not so much predictions for 2022 But more just an outlook of what I see happening away. I think 2022 is going to be a super exciting year So there's three main things I'm kind of like looking forward to one is I think the market is going to do kind of like very well in 2022 I think that we've been kind of like in this range of being moving on Especially I mean when it comes to eighth, I don't know about most other assets when it comes to eight I think it's gonna do very well. I think there's going to be a mania around l2s and the l2 tokens I think l2 is are gonna take off in a really big way in 2022 And I think that the merge is as I mentioned plenty of times before going to lead to a very very big narrative shift for aetherium on multiple fronts the first front is that we're gonna have a deflationary 8 all the time as long as The the way price is like 10 or 20 quay or something like that last time I worked it out It's going to be more deflationary than Bitcoin which is going to be a narrative talking point Especially for normies and stuff like that It's going to get if you're more proof of work and going to prove of stake Which is obviously a huge deal It's going to significantly de-risk aetherium for the more traditional investors because they're gonna be like, okay Well, this major upgrade is actually out of the way now and it's done and it was successful So, you know, but now it's safer to invest and you know that may seem crazy to you But a lot of people think like this because they have to I mean there's a lot of our traditional investors are regulated They can't just like throw money into anything They have to be careful about what they throw money into and have to weigh up all the risks and that's how they size things So it's gonna be a significant de-risking event there and you know, I mentioned the L2s as another another thing there and also I think that towards the end of 2022 the I'm hoping maybe I don't think like I'm hoping the narrative changes around aetherium scalability I mean, I'm hoping this happens in the first half of 2022 But I I think in the second half because I think the first half we're gonna have a lot of these L2s doing tokens There's gonna be a lot of rapid growth All these L2s are people gonna use them a lot of people gonna be really happy with them and they're gonna offer cheap fees But then I actually think that we run the risk of them hitting their limits because a lot of these things are still very limited They're not anywhere near their full capacity They have our training wheels on a lot of them are still centralized And I think that's going to be a counter narrative to aetherium scalability because people gonna hit those limits and be like what the hell Like I thought this was gonna be cheaper You know, what why is it kind of getting expensive again blah blah blah Then I think what's gonna happen is the L2s are going to basically Take their limits off or take their training wheels off or improve and then the second half of 2022 Will be I think like the steady-state people like okay Well aetherium can scale now a lot of the new users aren't going to be going to aetherium L1 We're gonna have lots of we're gonna hopefully have lots of centralized exchanges being Having bridges into these L2s and that's all going to be well and good So I really do think 2022 is going to be the year of the L2 if it's not I fear that aetherium I mean I think worst case scenario if the L2s fail to gain traction in 2022 if people just aren't interested in using them if they don't actually play it right if they don't do the marketing right they don't Do the business development right if they don't do tokens I actually fear that aetherium has a very real chance of losing It's kind of like lead here. I mean it really does hinge I know I know I'm not really kind of like a bearish on aetherium in general But I think that the L2s it's not enough just to I mentioned this yesterday It's not enough to just build it like you need to incentivize people to go there go look at literally any TVL chart for any chain it spikes as soon as there's my liquidity mining rewards to be had or as soon as there's token incentives There and it's obvious why people want to make money. They're gonna go there They're gonna make their money, and there's gonna be some sticky liquidity. It's the best marketing tool ever a token is amazing I mean obviously there's the Downside to a token when it's not performing amazingly it can kind of like make your community sour I can make people not want to obviously purchase it anymore And it can make your liquidity mining program not be as lucrative But just generally when a token is done right and people have skin in the game when there are rewards to be had when They can use the products It's just the best marketing tool ever and and as own flow of that is the best business development tool as well So I really do think that if we don't get our ass into gear in 2022 in terms of like the L2s actually scaling aetherium We stand a very real risk of kind of like completely losing the narrative and people just kind of like getting Sick of us saying you know the L2s are coming They're coming in the coming and then kind of like just using the other chains and kind of like aetherium losing its moat there I think there's a very very low chance of that happening I think it's basically 0% chance, but that is the worst case scenario, and that's why I'm pushing so hard I keep pushing the L2 teams like trying to signal to them do tokens guys like I know That you want to focus on building, but doing a token is part of building like that's what it is in crypto It's not like if you're a company In the traditional space like a non crypto space and you wait like seven years to IPO It's not like that because when you IPO you're not doing liquidity mining for your products It means you know if you go if you get to an IPO Most of the time your product is actually already got a lot of traction and the reason you're IPOing is because you know It's got a lot of traction and your investors like oh well. You know it's time to go public right we want an exit Tokens are the our big part of the products within crypto They're a big part of building so you know don't think of it as kind of like a speculative vehicle Don't think of it as just all we have to do a token cuz our investors want us to do it all because people want To want to DJ and speculate on it. They want to do that yes, and that's what a lot of crypto currently is But it's still the best marketing tool ever it's the best way to build a community It's the best way to get traction of things so I really really hope to see that play out into 2022 and I think it will I mean honestly zk-sync Arbitrum I'm sure optimism they've all done the I start where they've done the series B's at this point I think a stock we did a series C as well. I don't imagine them going much further than that I think the tokens are coming. I think they're coming very very soon is ek-sync that that's coming very very soon as I said 36 months months, I think they're all gonna have a token. There's already some with tokens right like metis There's there's a few other kind like forks out there There's obviously polygon as well with matic and stuff like that and there's a bunch of other bridge tokens, too That's another thing going into 2022 I think it's gonna be a big deal bridges because of the fact that l2 is if they you know when they take off bridges are Gonna be even more important. They're already pretty important, but they're gonna get they're gonna kind of like tag along for the ride as well So that's another big thing going into 2022 as well. But yeah, that's my thoughts guys I think I think I'm coming up on time here So that's my thoughts on kind of like just recapping briefly 2021 all the major themes what I expect going into 2022 I really do think it's gonna be a great year for a theorem the network and ethe the asset I think that we're gonna get to $10,000 at least in 2022 I think we can go much further than that, but I think that's finally gonna be the year where We finally gets the $10,000 that I've been kind of like calling for since I think early 2019 So it's gonna be a good like three years probably since since that's happened there But I think the most important thing for a theorem is getting that merge done obviously that's going to be probably the biggest event of the year in terms of a singular singular event for a theorem and I think The the obviously the other biggest things are the l2 stuff but price if price is going up everything becomes a big big deal I'm sure you've all noticed that like whenever the price is going up of an asset Everything a chain does or anything ecosystem does is amazing. You can do no wrong. It's all good guys Like everything's bullish But then when the price is going down it's kind of like the opposite thing there and this was especially felt in like 2018 2019 where everyone was fighting because it was a bear market and everyone was like depressed and sad and then the bull market came roaring back And everyone's like, oh my god, like this is awesome like we have so much money and Then actually I think the last six months has been back to basically what we're like in the bear market because sideways is probably the worst I think sideways Price action is worse than a bear market because at least in a bear market You know that the price is going down and you know that that's probably gonna continue like that for a while In a sideways market you got no idea what's going on. You're like, oh, is it gonna go up now? Oh, no, no, it's going back down again. Oh wait. No, it's going back up. Oh wait. No, it's going down It's just this constant kind of like yo-yo and it just it's really nauseating and it's really really frustrating I think that's what leads to a lot of toxicity as well But we'll just get super frustrated and they take it out on whoever they can as well there But uh, but yeah, I think that's going to be it for this special episode of the refill the last one of the year I hope all of you had a great 2021 I know a few of you have reached out before and said to me that you really Enjoyed the enjoy the refuel really enjoy my newsletter and that it's changed your lives actually So really humbled to hear that this young and it obviously keep doing the refuel into 2022. No plans on stopping it there I'm gonna try and do more standalone videos, too. I really really want to do more standalone videos because I still think that There's so much things out there that people have no idea about I mean people still think the merge is going to lower gas fees I really really want to kill that that um That narrative before it kind of like bites us in the ass once the merge happens and fees don't go down because I can already Picture it in my head the amount of fun that there's going to be Regardless of what what anyone says there's just gonna be heaps of fun that that happens after that, unfortunately Unfortunately, but I hope the L twos are in full swing by then so people don't even care that much at that point But we'll have to see but yeah, so I guess like happy new year I'll see you all in the new year for a big 2022. Hope you guys have something fun planned for your news I'm not sure what I'm doing yet, but I'm definitely going to be taking some time tomorrow night Just off so there won't be a refuel tomorrow obviously or anything like that There would be a newsletter either but there will be on Monday So yeah, thanks everyone for tuning in this year and I'll catch you all next year Be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give it a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter Join the discord channel and I'll catch you all next year.

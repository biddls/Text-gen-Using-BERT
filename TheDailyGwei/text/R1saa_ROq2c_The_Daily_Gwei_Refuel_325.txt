 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the Daily Gray Review. Where we cap the latest news in the Ethereum ecosystem. I'm your host, The Anthony Sosano and today is the 3rd of March 2022. Alright everyone, let's get into it. So another reminder from Trent Van Epps here today as part of his ongoing series of I guess like tweets about what's going to happen when the merge goes through or post merge. So today's tweet was the merge slash proof of stake will not reduce fees on mainnet. Now this is something that I have been tooting my horn about or tooting the horn about for months now and I've told you guys that I see plenty of people out there thinking that the merge or proof of stake or eth2 whatever you want to call it is going to significantly or materially reduce gas fees on layer 1 mainnet. Now as you all know it was not going to do this it basically has no effect. I mean the block times are going from 13 seconds to 12 seconds but that is not really going to have a material effect as you have seen over the last few weeks though that when the activity on chain goes down the gas fees go down. At the end of the day guys the gas fees the fee market is really just a function of supply and demand. Demand for block space supply is limited so there's when there's more demand the prices go up and there's less demand the prices go down. Simple as that. There is literally I mean it's not complicated like but the thing is the merge slash proof of stake does not do anything to reduce fees. Obviously as you guys know Ethereum is taking the modular scaling approach so to reduce fees we're leveraging layer 2s and layer 1 improvements will go towards utilizing or sorry improving layer 2s as well. So and you know Trent goes on to say in his tweet smaller block slash slot times do increase available block space but not significantly that's that 13 seconds to 12 seconds block times that I talked about. An average block space is only one input which influences fees the other being demand. As I mentioned near term scaling lower fees will be on layer 2s and I mean I actually would say like near term and even long term would just be on layer 2s but I think what Trent kind of like saying here is that you know once the merge is done we're going to be really really focused on getting these layer 1 upgrades done. You know obviously sharding, dang sharding, statelessness, state expiry, EIP4488 to reduce costs for roll ups and blob adding kind of like blob transactions and stuff like that. All that's going to help significantly with scaling Ethereum but that is not happening at the time of the merge. The merge is literally as I mentioned before just going from proof of work to proof of stake. That's the only thing that kind of like happens guys. We're just hot swapping out the consensus mechanism. Now I'm making it sound simple but it's not. It's obviously a very big undertaking and it's a very big achievement but the end users really aren't going to feel anything from this I don't think. I think the most the end users will feel is more predictable block times but even then I don't think there's going to be much much kind of like difference felt there. But in saying that shortly after that hopefully about six months after that we'll have the Shanghai update go live which brings kind of like more scalability to layer twos. But layer twos already are getting like so cheap lately guys. I mean I know they're also influenced by the layer one gas cost but a swap on arbitrum optimism right now is one to two dollars I think I saw it at. That's pretty crazy right for leveraging Ethereum security. I know you know you can get cheaper swaps elsewhere and that's all well and good but I think you know the costs have come down a lot. They were like four, five, six dollars, seven dollars, eight dollars for a swap right. Now we're at the one and two dollar mark as I said influenced by layer one gas fees to an extent but also these roll ups are doing significant improvements on their own without having to touch layer one or change layer one. They're kind of like optimizing themselves and bringing more efficiency at layer two. You know arbitrum doesn't even have nitro alive yet and they've managed to squeeze out all of these improvements so very very awesome to see that. But if you want to I guess read Trent's previous tweets there's three other tweets here about kind of like what's happening. I guess going to the merge you can just click through he's kind of quote tweeted it each time he's talked about it. So definitely go check those out and for those of you who don't know I mean Trent has been around for a while I talk about him a lot on the refill. He's an ecosystem person at the Ethereum Foundation so he's across pretty much everything got to do with core dev. I would say like I mentioned yesterday how Ben Edgington is really great with keeping up into the weeds with ETH2 stuff. I would say that Trent is really great on keeping up with pretty much everything on the ETH1 and ETH2 stuff but maybe from like a bit of a higher level but also from the community level as well. Like he's very involved in I guess talking to different people within the community different projects and stuff like that and making sure that they're all ready for major upgrades. He was instrumental in making sure a lot of the wallets and infrastructure providers were ready for EIP-1559 and he still helps them to this day. And he's also the guy behind Stateful Works which is a kind of like initiative for Ethereum cultural artifacts and I've talked about this before. There was the 1555 NFT series which is run by Stateful Works and there was a lot of information about it and there was also the book, the beacon book that was kind of produced by Stateful Works as well. So Trent's doing a lot of great work and I'm loving these tweets from him lately. Alright so SuperFizz shared that Avato now offers support for running Rockerpool mini pools. So as SuperFizz says here, this improves access to a decentralized staking solution for many people who otherwise couldn't participate. So for full details you can check out the blog post which I'll link in the YouTube description below. So Avato is a client diversity client. They're planning to support Prism right now it seems and then Avato kind of replied and said they're planning to support multiple options before the ETH2 merge and they are monitoring the development closely. So and then they say client diversity is one of their goals, we're supporting other beacon chain implementations as well. But you know it's pretty cool. I mean obviously you know the fact that they just have Prism right now may be a deal breaker for some people that don't want to spin up the supermajority client which is totally fine but I'm sure they'll be adding other ones relatively soon. So basically they build themselves as a plug and play blockchain computer to run dapps. Essentially you can go to their website, you can purchase one of their Avato kind of I guess boxes here which comes preloaded with an operating system that allows you to just kind of do a one click install of different kind of blockchain nodes, clients, validators, all that good stuff there and it makes it super simple to do those sorts of things and not just for the blockchains themselves but now for the services around them like Rockerpool and a bunch of other ones too. So if you don't know what Avato is, haven't checked them out before, definitely do so. I mean you can just go to their website like here ava.do, you can kind of like see here there's the Avato cloud use cases hardware you can buy from them, they can be by little knucks kind of like Avato i7 and they give you a price and everything here and then there's different kind of like models as well. So you can go check this out if you want just a simple kind of like box to run nodes on, to run your staking software and all that sort of stuff. I personally opted to build my own as you guys know my own staking box, it used to be in the background of my videos simply because I wanted like full and total control over the hardware plus I wanted it to look cool as well. Like not to say that these boxes look bad or anything but they're quite simple right like they're just you know if I go to the hardware as you saw they're quite simple kind of like boxes looks a little bit like a modem or a router or something like that which is totally fine I mean if you just want it to blend in this is a great solution for you but for me I wanted a bit more aesthetic to mine like as you can see around me I love having things on display around me so I opted for the kind of like more the more noisy kind of like setup there but it's all just kind of like the same parts at the end of the day I mean as I said like there's different kind of specs of the Avato hardware there's the i7 which is an Intel i7 with 32 gig of ram 2 terabytes of SSD storage and it's fanless as well which means it's 100% silent that'll set you back 1600 USD but this is kind of like the top of the range one so this will allow you to do everything that you need to do in order to run obviously needs to validate our beacon node and an eth1 node but you also be able to kind of like run other other nodes and other kind of I guess validators and other networks as well so if you just want to kind of like run I guess like an ethereum full node and and just stake then the Avato i5 would definitely be fine for you and that will set you back 1099 USD so yeah there's a few different options there for you to choose from but as always you can build it yourself if you want to and the cool thing is about I guess like the software is that the software can be installed on any hardware that the software that's on the Avato so I mean I've gone blank on the name right now there's a specific name for the software that I've just kind of like forgotten here but yeah I've installed it on other kind of like pieces of hardware before and it works fine so there's no need to buy an Avato kind of like plug and play device if you don't want to but that's probably the easiest way to get started with all of this. All right so L2bit has a new diagram on zk sync's page that kind of explains how zk sync's smart contracts work so you can go to the page here I'll link it in the youtube description but it kind of like shows how smart contracts work on zk sync or sorry how the zk sync smart contracts work so you can see here the main roll-up contract is identified with the verifier with the upgrade kind of like gatekeeper and with the governance contract as as well so as you guys know L2bit provides more information about the L2s than literally any other website in existence by far I mean this is the only website that I use for all this information I don't think it's documented anywhere except maybe the official websites of the different kind of I guess L2s out there but even then they have it's kind of like buried in their documentation not on purpose but just because they have a lot of documentation whereas on L2bit it just kind of pulls all the relevant information out it highlights it in red it tells you kind of like what the biggest risks are it gives you links to all the different kind of like contracts and stuff like that which is what we want to see and kind of like their latest edition is kind of like zk sync's contracts obviously zk sync's been getting a lot of attention lately because they have their zk avm on testnet but this is really really cool to see that there's just kind of like more stuff here and there's obviously links to more references and resources you know the funny thing is is that you can go to the L2bit dot com website click on to each of these L2s scroll down read all the stuff on L2bit and then click through to each of these kind of like references to learn even more about all of this sort of stuff and you could probably spend a good like I mean week two weeks or something just going through all this like I mean not not not straight right but like you could spend like a good amount of time just going through each of these projects and then going to the references and kind of like reading about how it all works and you'll learn pretty much everything there is to learn about L2s at this stage I would say I mean they're all implementing different kind of like solutions obviously some optimistic roll-ups some zk roll-ups some of the lydians some even plasma some hybrids I mean there's so much going on but you you know cooking through and reading about the different solutions and reading all the different resources out there is probably the best way to get caught up with everything layer two like that's if you want to become like a layer two expert right don't do all of that if you're just interested in saying that you're not going to do all of that if you're just interested in staying at the at the high level of the of the L2 stuff which you probably only need the refill for that but if you want to dig deep really really deep you can do that and they link to the documentation of each of the kind of like solutions I mean if I'm just on arbitrums page now you can go to the arbitrum documentation which is at developer.offchainlabs.com and you can see kind of like everything here and and go through the developer's kickstart tutorials you know how the messaging works guys like this is just one section this is messaging between layers there's token bridging confirmation and finality like I mean even as a non-dev you can just read to all of this and kind of like see all the stuff that's gone into this sort of stuff and how you know kind of like not complex it is but how detailed it is and how much kind of like thought has gone into got into everything there so definitely do that if you're interested in learning more about L2 and you know as I said before the perfect time to to learn about this sort of stuff is when the market is quiet I know the market seems to be kind of like heating back up again but when I say market being quiet I mean like we're in this kind of like range and there's just kind of like not many people around and the things are much quieter I mean Twitter is still so quiet I mean the most things I'm seeing on Twitter lately is just the Ukraine Russia stuff I hardly even see much crypto stuff anymore but just generally with the crypto stuff it's still super quiet and if there is talk about it it's usually about the Ukraine Russia stuff which to be honest I mean I'm glad there's a lot of talk about that because obviously you know this is crypto's kind of like moment a lot like a crypto is is really entering the mainstream here I mean just today actually not to go off topic here but I think this is pretty on topic but just today we saw that I believe um one of the governments one of the western governments kind of like ordered that the centralized exchanges make it hard for Russia to get around their sanctions by using centralized exchanges so obviously I guess crypto at least on the centralized exchange side is pretty much integrated with the financial system at this point like it is considered part of the worldwide financial system which is pretty wild to think about and at the end of the day we are building these tools like Ethereum and you know Bitcoin the layer 2 is all that sort of stuff to be neutral so there's the governments can't order Ethereum to basically block transactions or censor transactions or or freeze funds or anything like that obviously that's still all possible if the network is being kind of like overtaken by a 51 attack or if the miners decide to collude and censor transactions but it's extremely extremely difficult it is very very unlikely to happen on Ethereum and Bitcoin that is but on other chains you know it's it's easier like there are some chains out there that are just super super centralized that it's very easy to kind of like block these stuff up so I think you know people have laughed at me before by when I've said that these kind of like blockchains need to resist nation states because if they can't do that then they're pointless well I don't think people are going to be laughing for very much longer guys I mean this is the time where decentralization does get tested like if the governments around the world the the the US government the European governments the you know the Asian governments if they all kind of like came together and had the same narrative where they're like well we need to stop you know whether it's Russia or someone else we need to stop them using crypto to get around our sanctions well I mean they'll go for the centralized exchanges first which is obviously the path of least resistance then they probably go for stable coins they'll start they'll they'll ask stablecoin issuers to freeze addresses that they suspect not that they can prove but they suspect are involved with illicit activity and of course it's going to get frozen straight away because you know it the centralized exchanges or the centralized operators of these stablecoins are not going to say no to the US government they're going to be like okay well I mean we'll freeze it for now but like kind of like if they want to push it further they can fight it and basically be like well we'll freeze it but you guys gotta you guys gonna have to kind of like prove to us why we froze it sort of thing but still I mean you're not going to be going up against the US government as a centralized crypto exchange based in the US right you can try I mean you can take them to court and things like that later on but in the heat of the moment especially during times like this yeah it's not going to work and then you know what happens if there's evidence of these countries that have been sanctioned using blockchains to get around the sanctions well the governments are not going to sit idly by and basically let that happen they what they're going to do is they're going to do one of two things they're either going to realize that they can't control Ethereum and Bitcoin or and this is probably the most likely outcome more likely outcome I should say they're going to try and control it they're going to try and see which ones they can control which ones they can shut down which ones they can block access to and to be honest I mean they can block access to Ethereum and Bitcoin via ordering centralized exchanges to block withdrawals to those networks but that's the worst they can do there they can't overtake the network they can't force the miners and in the future validators to censor transactions or anything like that they're powerless there but that's for Ethereum and Bitcoin when it comes to other chains there are certain things they can do a lot of the DPOS chains have a very small validator set and that can control the network that are based in jurisdictions where these governments reside such as the US and Europe so that's going to be the true test guys like that at the end of the day you don't know what's truly decentralized I think and you and you can't really it's kind of like you can't really prove it until these things kind of like show their their true colors that show they have no clothes and I think we're going to get to that point sooner rather than later but yeah a little bit of a tangent there I guess but I think it's very very relevant to what we're seeing lately and I do think that people are going to realize more and more why decentralization matters at the end of the day. Alright so Orbiter Finance has another update today that they now support StarkNet on Gurly so you can choose StarkNet on orbiter.finance and bridge StarkNet in to testnet so this is cool I mean I've been covering Orbiter recently but now they've kind of like supporting StarkNet Gurly and obviously as you guys know StarkNet is both on testnet and mainnet which is really really cool to see but it's cool to see orbiter finance just like getting up there I mean I only started talking about these guys maybe two months ago or something like that they came out of kind of nowhere I mean I wonder when their twitter account was created okay they could have took out was created January 2014 so it must have been repurposed there but I don't think they've got these guys have been around for very long so very cool to see them I guess they're still in alpha but very cool to see them adding networks really quickly and and kind of like getting their name out there and it's just it's just great to see more bridges coming online obviously as I've talked about there's a lot of risks using these sorts of things which which actually is a perfect segue into little Cohen's thread today little Cohen kind of like works at at as growth at hot protocol so he would know a thing or two about bridges but basically this is a thread about bridge security and kind of like it's a really great thread it goes through kind of like what can happen the risks and the trade-offs and all that sort of stuff so I say so just reading this thread but you know since we saw the massive exploit with the the wormhole bridge there hasn't really been any other security incidents on bridges I've seen yet but don't let that give you a false sense of security guys like that doesn't mean that these bridges are suddenly all super secure and everyone's funds are secure no you've got to keep your kind of wits about you especially when using newer protocols like orbiter finance which is still in alpha you really need to realize that alpha doesn't mean hey ape your whole net worth into this bridge and you know I kind of like yolo in and no that's not that's not kind of like how it works there you need to realize that alpha beta that they mean you know this is still kind of like very risky software this is still kind of like basically being tested right it's basically in the kind of like you know maybe they're kind of like testing in prod so to speak on main net but still they shouldn't be treated as kind of like live kind of like you know super safe production software here and you know honestly most things in crypto shouldn't be treated as super safe for really safe software at the end of the day as I said to you guys plenty of times before every smart contract in existence has the possibility of having a bug in it even if it's one line of code can have a bug in it and it's just kind of like a function of I guess like time as well like you know the funny thing is about the time thing I've had this discussion with many people before people kind of argue that the longer a smart contract has been around a longer you know a set of code has been around the safer it is I don't actually necessarily agree with that because there's been tons of examples of things in the web 2 world that have existed for decades and then there's a massive bug found in it like a critical bug found in it you know 10 20 years later now if that's the case how do you kind of like trust any of this stuff well I mean there's kind of kind of insurance protocols out there that you can kind of take insurance against you know maybe don't put like your whole net worth into one smart contract maybe spread out the risk say you're using kind of like three different yield farming protocols out there that's better than just putting all your funds kind of like one because if that if one of them kind of gets hacked or something like that then you you kind of like protected by by being the other two maybe your yield is less but I guess that's kind of like the trade-off you take there and then the protocols themselves are having their own I guess like insurance funds too to cover any losses that they suffer so there are ways to kind of protect users but I don't think anyone should ever say that a smart contract or any set of code is 100 secure and 100 bug free it's just impossible to to make that assertion and if you if you do say that and later it gets kind of like hacked or anything like that well maybe you had the hubris to not prepare for that and then the user funds are all gone so I think just taking all that into account guys I mean I know I've said before that one of the only protocols I kind of like trust with like a large amount of my net worth is I guess like assets is is maker and I've used it plenty of times before but even maker can could have a critical bug in it like I'm not saying it doesn't and you know I have obviously have a lot of my eth in in staking right now on the beacon chain that code has only been live for like a year and what three months at this point it's not super secure either you can't claim that it's like ultra secure you can't claim that it has like lindy or anything behind it but I'm well aware of those risks I take those risks and that's on me if anything happens but I think this is true for basically every piece of code so just yeah just another friendly reminder for you guys to kind of like take precautions when using these sorts of things see what would happen if an exploit was to happen like will you be covered by the protocol itself is there kind of ways to take an insurance how much would you stand to lose all these sorts of stuff so so yeah and definitely go give little comments thread about bridge security and bridges here a read I'll link it in the youtube description for you to do so so Rocco from the spruce id team published a blog post today called why signing with ethereum is a game change up part one so I highly recommend giving this blog post to read obviously I'm not going to read it out on on the refuel as I said before sign in with ethereum on chain identity all this sort of stuff about you know around kind of like this area is super important for I guess the the growth of this industry you know I often say that I think the two most important things that are that I'm most excited about to reach mass adoption scaling and privacy if I had to pick a third it would be things like this right like on chain identity signing with ethereum because it's such a simple thing but it's such a powerful tool and I've explained why in previous episodes I won't go through this again but I think you know as I've said before I'd much rather be able to sign in with ethereum to things rather than having to sign in with facebook or sign in with twitter or centralized service because you know you get portability interoperability composability all that good stuff that we're used to within defi all without an intermediary all in a decentralized way and be able to kind of like carry identity with us so very cool uh thing that you should give you know you should give this blog post to read to learn more about this how it works some of the technicals behind it as well and you know how it works on a technical level with signing messages and a friendly reminder again guys signing a message on ethereum does not cost gas fees that's another shitty narrative out there people actually believe that signing a message cost gas fees I mean you don't even have to believe anyone go sign a message on ethereum main net right now like go sign in with you know sign into something with with ethereum uh right now you don't have to it's just sign and that's it because all you're doing is signing a message using your private key you're not doing an on-chain transaction it's just so insane to me that these narratives persist and it's it kind of like even more insane to me that um the the bad narratives for some reason are always the ones that are the most popular and it goes back to this old adage I don't know if if um andreas andompolis was the first one to say this but I've heard him say it plenty of times before is that kind of like um bullshit just tends to spread 10 times faster than the truth and then you know trying to kind of like correct that bullshit is basically impossible from there so yeah anyway go give this blog post to read uh I'll link it in the youtube description for you to do so all right so finally here we have a call out from the EF ecosystem support program they put out a tweet saying calling all academics research centers PhD students and others interested in researching ethereum we're excited to announce a new wave of 750 000 in grants to fund formal ethereum related research learn more and submit your project proposals by 22nd of April in this blog post this is really cool it's more money going towards core ethereum research here which is always a good thing to see and this is coming directly from the ethereum foundation support program so if you're interested in this if this is something up your alley definitely go check out the blog post as I said the deadline for applying for these grants is April 22nd 2022 so you have about just over six weeks from now um but I'll link this in the youtube description for you to check out now I've got a few minutes left here so one last thing I wanted to talk about which is actually related to this was about research in general within crypto and how I think that ethereum has obviously been the leader for quite a while now in terms of like bleeding edge research and the most interesting things coming out of the ethereum ecosystem and I think that's going to be the case for a long while but I do want to caution people from getting too kind of I guess like bottlenecked in things like you know I don't think an echo chamber is the right word I think people use the term echo chamber like in a really you know in a really wrong way but I think it's really wrong way these days they use it to deride people and say you know you're just like an echo chamber you don't know what's going on around you it's like yeah okay I mean some people may be stuck in that but at the end of the day like if you're only interested in keeping up with what's happening in ethereum and you're happy being in the ethereum echo chamber well I mean is that necessarily a bad thing like if you're happy if you're aware of it if you're just like whatever like I don't care about all the other stuff going on I'm happy in ethereum then that's totally fine as long as you're not kind of like spouting bullshit or deriding other ecosystems I mean an example of this is the bitcoin maximalists who definitely live in their own echo chamber but not only do they live in their echo chamber they also kind of like yell outside of it right they yell at the ethereum people they say ethereum centralized they say it's a scam blah blah blah all that sort of stuff but if you just sit in ethereum land sort of like what I do and you're not there out there just spouting all the bullshit off and calling other projects scams and and kind of like saying that it's all worthless I think that's totally fine but in saying that there are interesting ideas out of other ecosystems that haven't come from ethereum right like as I said the vast majority of the coolest things that I've seen have been in the ethereum ecosystem but there are definitely ideas in other ecosystems that that are interesting and you know to I've bashed Solana a lot in the past but to Solana's credit they're actually building a pretty decent execution layer now the reason I've bashed Solana in the past is because I don't think that that execution layer can work at at quote unquote layer one with their consensus engine I think they're going to run into plenty of problems and they already have and I don't think it's going to scale to the world but I mean I you know I reckon Solana can be a really great execution layer meaning it could be a really great layer two and doesn't even have to use ethereum as a settlement layer it could use any consensus engine that it limits itself at layer one as a as a settlement kind of layer but at the end of the day we might we may see someone just fork Solana make rip out the consensus and just kind of like settle it to ethereum and it'll be funny because what if it works better like I actually think objectively it would actually work better than the Solana Solana chain itself because of the fact that it's taking the modular approach instead of doing the monolithic approach but that's where credit should be due like Solana is a very different chain to ethereum they build things from the ground up they're using rust instead instead of solidity they're doing a lot of you know different things out there but my problem with it has always been the thesis that you could scale everything at layer one I just don't think that's going to work and we've already seen the pitfalls of that and not just Solana you know the terror ecosystem is quite interesting with what they're doing with stablecoin with ust I know a lot of people call it a ponzi and all that sort of stuff but you know the longer it sticks around the longer it actually works maybe it maybe it ends up working maybe we're all where I mean I haven't called it upon maybe people are all wrong about that like I don't know but that's another interesting thing that's happening there that's not happening in ethereum and you know there are some pockets here and there are other things going on but there's not I mean not really I mean some like a lot of the other l1s are just like evm clones they're not very very interesting and as I said the vast majority of interesting stuff is still happening on ethereum but you know if you're if you don't want to be in a quote unquote like echo chamber and you're not happy being in an echo chamber you want to kind of like expand a little bit I would recommend going and viewing at going and kind of like looking into these other ecosystems to see what they've got going on but as I said most of it is not interesting but there are pockets there and you don't have to like go out and buy the tokens either if you don't want to it's not like you have to basically go all in on the ecosystems or whatever but essentially what you can do is you can just check out what they've got going on and then you can say okay well is there anything like this going on in ethereum you know why not is it is it can I can I bring it to ethereum you know can I do something here just just a cool thing to do I think but you know and I've been doing this for for a while now it's not a new thing for me I mean it's funny because I always get called an ethmaxy and I can bet you know I can bet you that I know more about the a lot of the l1 ecosystems that their biggest fans do because I do keep up with them just not you know day to day in the detail in the weeds but I do keep up with what they're doing to see if anything's actually you know innovative and to be honest guys like I don't think any of the stuff that the other l1s are doing with regards to scaling is innovative at all I think all the scaling innovation is happening basically on ethereum coupled with like the l2 stuff and the modular stack and obviously there's other chains that aren't out yet like celestia which is doing interesting things and polygonal veil and stuff like that but but yeah I mean as I said always good to branch out but uh but yeah I mean on my end I haven't seen like anything too interesting but there are pockets out there which are worth researching but I think on that note I'm gonna leave it at that for today so thank everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give me a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the discord channel and I'll catch you all tomorrow thanks everyone

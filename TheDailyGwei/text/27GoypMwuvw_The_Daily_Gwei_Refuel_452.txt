 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the deadly gray refuel worry capitalities news in the etheric ecosystem I'm your host and his son. Oh, it says 21st September 2022. All right, everyone. Let's get into it So some new stablecoin regulation out of the US today So this DB account on Twitter said issuing a stablecoin without approval from appropriate regulators It could be punishable by up to five years in prison and a 1 million dollar fine under draft house bill so this is a bill in the US house, not the I'm not the Senate here and you can read the full details at this block link now As far as my reading goes this I think only applies to algo stablecoins or stablecoins that are backed by Self-referential collateral. So for example, this would apply to UST which obviously doesn't exist anymore while it cannot exist But it's not really a stablecoin anymore But because Luna was backing it up or not backing it up so to speak And it wouldn't apply to things like die or USDC or USDT right because they have real collateral backing it up I don't think this is going to be like the way it is when if it gets accepted into law if it gets accepted in Into regulation because this is just in the house right now. So I have to pass the house then go to the Senate It's probably gonna die in the Senate. Um, I don't know if we'll see this go go much further than that But the punishments are quite severe I mean like you can even just see punishment by up to five years in prison and a 1 million dollar fine Like that's crazy for a I guess like white-collar crime like those sorts of punishments Don't really get ditched out very often and I guess we can all see why this is What bias has come to be it's pretty much because of terror like this is just more fallout from the terror debacle Where regulators are looking at what happened with terror what happened with UST and looking at all the people that got wrecked and are like Well, we can't let this go on They were just looking for an excuse to rate to over-regulate the industry and they got one we gave them one on a silver platter Guys, like just ridiculous right now, even though this only applies to algo stables at least from my understanding I still think it's a stupid regulation and a stupid bill at the end of the day Like you shouldn't regulate away experimentation and regulate away innovation But I think that obviously when you look at terror It was a really bad idea and a lot of people called it as a bad idea Now if we want to encourage innovation and experimentation without things like terror happening over and over again The way you do it is you put guardrails in place as the creator of those projects, right? Like you do like a guarded launch as we've seen a lot of projects do or we do kind of regulation within the industry ourselves But that's a lot harder I think because as we saw a lot of people called out terror Like for months and months and months and were attacked relentlessly attacked for it by the the lunatics, right? And they got to a point where I think a lot of people capitulated and just said wow Okay, you know terror is actually gonna work or us T is actually gonna work This is a new paradigm and then it obviously all came crashing down So there is a fine line here and a fine balance But I think the problem is is that self-regulation is really really hard, especially in the crypto industry Because people just don't care especially when they're making money, especially during bull markets and on top of that It's very hard to know what is a actual credible experiment slash innovation and what's that and something that's actually being built For the longer term and with good intentions versus something that is only being built as something to extract money out of the ecosystem like that proving that is basically Impossible because you need to go through the courts to prove that and even then it'd be very very hard to do So I think that governments are doing what they do best Which is regulate and draft new bills and draft laws like this is to be expected and I said I believe For even before terror collapsed I had been saying for a while that stable coins are going to be the thing that they regulate It's the easiest thing for them to regulate and it's coming It's taken a bit longer than I thought but it's not surprising to me at all And there's also a section that state pulled out here That said the current draft bill on the negotiation between House Financial Services Committee chair Maxine waters and the committee's top Republican Patrick McHenry would create a two-year ban on stable coins that aren't fully backed by cash or highly liquid assets like US Treasury bonds The bill would also create a two-year grace period for operators with coins that aren't currently collateralized by those assets to change their business model and receive approval the Federal Reserve would also be directed to study the economic impact of US digital dollar a process that central the central bank has already begun with things like CBDCs, right? So this is the most interesting thing. I think here is that like on the surface This doesn't actually look like a quote unquote bad regulation or bad bill right because it goes after the things that we know to be Just bad in crypto and we know to have heard of a lot of people in crypto But as I just explained there are other ways to regulate and to prevent these things from happening But it is a delicate balance now I do like that they seem to have a good grasp here that stable coins can be backed by you know cash or higher liquid assets such as other stable coins like our dies backed by USDC and higher liquid assets like ETH or they can be backed by self referential collateral Like what happened with USD it was backed by Luna which had that infinite mint function and it would obviously it was it was based On some kind of like algorithmic behavior, so it wasn't great And I do like that they just also proposed that a grace period here for operators to Basically stop building these things and build something that's collateralized But as I said and as I said plenty of times in the past I just I'm not a general fan of financial regulations But again, I'm not surprised at all by this like I saw this this morning, and I was a yep, okay Well, it's just more stable coin regulation, and then I looked at the details, and I'm like okay. Yep. Thanks, Dokwan This is all you bro like this is this is literally all him and all the terror debacle like Because they're making delineation here between highly Sorry between stable coins backed by cash and high high liquid assets and stable coins backed by basically nothing right and they wouldn't be making that Delineation if terror hadn't blown up like it did and I don't think that would be being this harsh about it either I mean up to five years in prison and a 1 million dollar fine is very very harsh, right? So you can kind of look look at this as well and think well There are other things out there that may look like a terror or an algo stable, but are actually not like that, but yeah, okay? They're not totally backed by cash and highly liquid assets But there's other reasons why they keep their peg or other reasons why they behave that way so again This does kill innovation off and it kills experimentation off if it was actually to go into to law to become a regulation here But at the same time like we shouldn't be surprised now That's not me kind of I guess giving excuses or giving a cop-out here for regulation. I don't think that this is the solution But I guess like it's gonna come whether I think that or not like and there's nothing I can personally do because I'm not a US citizen I can't vote for or against the representatives here I can't do anything right like all I can do is spread the word I know that I have a lot of Americans obviously that watch this show and listen to the show But but yeah, we're gonna have to see how this progresses as I said like the thing is a lot of things usually get passed In the house, and then just die in the Senate, so we'll have to see but I don't imagine this being a I Don't know too controversial like it's kind of weird when I look at the two I guess parties in the US like Democrats and Republicans and the part of the people within those parties they have varied I Guess varied views on things, and I'm not gonna get political here But yeah, you definitely want to look at it yourself and look at where each party sits on these sorts of issues but obviously Right now it's not looking great Especially from like the SEC's point of view with whatever Gary gensler is up to and whatever he's saying And other kind of like regulations and restrictions that just keep coming every other day, but at the same time They just draft bills They're not in law Just yet and at the end of the day like anything can be drafted anything can be put forward and anyone can say whatever they Want but it just depends on the end results, so yeah anyway? I'll link this in YouTube description you can go check out the full breakdown from the block here Alright, so a Danny round Ryan announced on Twitter that a Seri IP 2982 or serenity phase 0 was finally moved to Final took just over two years a fun fact the merge happened exactly two years after this EIP is publishing date So I remember when this first got published as like a draft or whatever and me moving to final Status means that it's done This is just like amazing I mean it feels so much longer than two years for me because like I've been following this stuff so closely But just thinking back to when this was proposed if you had told me that it would take two years to get to the merge I would have said oh, no. I'm more optimistic I think it's gonna be quicker than that, but I also wouldn't I would have said oh two years isn't that long okay? Well yet, technically two years isn't that long relative to two other things? But it feels a lot longer than two years aside like especially because if you think about it two years ago was 2020 right it was like what September 2020 that was the I guess like end of d5 summer and At the time the beacon chain wasn't even live yet right the beacon chain went live December 1st 2020 So just cool to see this moved into the final status here and just like going through this I read through this You know plenty of different times when I during the development of The beacon chain the merge all that sorts of stuff there and for those of you who don't know The e2 was known as serenity at one point as well So I was like you know working towards serenity or getting to serenity and there was different phases as part of the quote-unquote e2 Roadmap like phase zero was gonna be the beacon chain launched in phase one was gonna be sharding phase 1.5 was gonna be like something similar to the merge though and then phase two was gonna be I think like full sharding was like I can't remember exactly what the details were but there were these phases and They got scrapped because it made more sense to do it the way we're doing it now But just I took a little trip down memory lane after seeing this on Twitter today I just wanted to highlight that for you guys All right, so an interesting little research paper here published by Dionysus Zindros I hope I said his name right here talking about proofs of proof of stake with sublinear complexity If that means nothing to you, it's all good because it means nothing to me either But the interesting part of this tweet thread and the thing that I understood the most was this tweet here where they said where he said The goal of this work is to build a wallet or client that can bootstrap into a theorem without downloading the whole blockchains history But still validating everything without trusting a server contrary to metamask or in Fuhrer So this is basically like a light client and this is one of the holy grails of a theorem is with developing these light clients where essentially you don't have to use a full node to To download the whole blockchain history and bootstrap your own I guess RPC so to speak right so you can basically Have an RPC on a mobile phone for example and be able to relay your own transactions We with full security and full trust that what you're doing what you're the chain that you're looking at is the right one and you're interacting With the right thing so you don't have to trust you can verify This research you can go check out for yourself. It's quite technical I don't understand it under the hood But it does look very interesting and there is a thread as well to go along with this But yeah light clients is another thing that you guys should be learning about and paying attention to as we progress through the etherium roadmap It is extremely important And it goes hand in hand with things like the verge and statelessness But those sorts of things are definitely coming and they're going to add a lot of value to aetherium All right, so summer is that has a thread here today all around the aetherium merge and how some solo stakers Have enjoyed perfect or near perfect performance pre merge, but are experiencing Degregated performance post merge so he explains why this is the case and some of the reasons are I mean one of the major reasons Are resources because pre merge you didn't have to run your own execution layer client you could outsource that to a third party But now post merge you have to run your own execution client which takes up more resources So if you had something that didn't have you had some hardware that didn't have those resources Then you would be feeling the um the pinch here. Maybe your validator feels are slower Maybe it's not attesting to it blocks as fast as it once was not as effective as it once was And these kind of these resources are like RAM storage CPU along with SSD performance There's also issues with client performance and client bugs Especially on the minority ones from what I've seen so and user error and things like that But yeah, I mean generally this stuff will get ironed out and it's not critical or anything like that But it's good to highlight that in a post merge world things did change under the hood for Especially for solo stakers who manage all their own stuff and I think that they're gonna just I guess like it's like the the Participation rate on the beacon chain where it's just self healing like people are just gonna pay attention to this They're going to fix whatever needs fixing and it'll all be well and good so give this thread a read I'll link it in the YouTube description, but I just thought it was something very important that was highlighted here All right, so I came across this new a website called a lucky staker dot-com and this go like the other actually the other day I should give some context here in the disco channel I was doing some really rough terrible napkin math on what percent chance you have each day of proposing a block with With a solo validator so you can see here that this website actually outlines that for you based on different time intervals So every day you have a one point six seven percent chance to propose a block currently So it's based on the amount of validators there are on the beacon chain like the more validators the less chance there is for each Individual validator to propose a block the less the more chance there is right so every one day you have one point six seven percent Chance 30 days is a thirty nine point five eight percent chance ninety days is a seventy seven point nine percent chance and 180 days Is a ninety five percent chance almost a hundred percent so you could expect on average For each of your validators as a solo staker to propose a block twice a year on average and proposing a block is only one but for proposing a block you get rewards and obviously you don't just get the block reward you get The fees and the potential meV as well But that's not the only way you earn rewards your own words for a testing and being part of sync committees and all that sorts of stuff as well, so The thing the reason I was doing this napkin math because I was trying to figure out like for my for my own Validators like how what my chance would be and obviously I'm not going to say what my chance would be because it would give away How many validators I have but I wanted to work out what the chances were of a hundred percent chance in a day as well Like so for a hundred percent chance in a day I mean you just do the naive math here 100 divided by one point six seven you would need 60 validators to to do that right so and that's each day, so you would one of your sixty validators each day or You know it almost I pretty much 100% chance would propose a block on that day And that's all I just did the math again on that that's one thousand nine hundred and twenty eight It's not how much you would need to propose a block by of one of your validators each day now every thirty days it gets A lot more a lot easier right you would only need two and a half validators I think not even that obviously kind of half a validator, but two and a half validators To propose a block every 30 days as a hundred percent chance and then obviously it gets a lot higher from there on these intervals Yeah, so I think you know there aren't many people out there who would have 60 solo validators that they run to be able to Get a block every day, but there definitely are some out there You know I mean, I wish I was one of those I will give away a little bit there I definitely don't have 60 validators I wish I did because that'd be really cool, but there are people out there who do and obviously you know when you count pools Into these sorts of stuff it makes it it's different, but this is just strictly speaking about solo validators So I thought that was just a cool little stat to show here But even if you're running one your chance of proposing a block each Yeah is a hundred percent like you're at least gonna propose at the very least even if you're the most unlucky Validator in the world you're you're at least gonna propose one a year And I in an ideal scenario you'll propose to a year As long as I'm doing my kind of I guess extrapolation here because it only shows every 180 days Which is obviously six months, and I'm extrapolating that out to 365 days And you have like over 100% chance right so you have almost 100% chance every 180 days Then yeah, you should propose it to two blocks, and if you're a lucky validator I mean the thing is as well is that because it's based on a it's random and it's based on a percentage chance There are some extremely lucky validators out there that propose blocks every month for example right like and it's a 40% chance So it's not actually you know extremely lucky It is on average very lucky But you can see actually on the big in-chain website the the validators with the most rewards and some of them haven't even been around for a while, but because they've been really lucky and because They've even been luckier by proposing a block that had a lot of fees in it But if at one point in time or a lot of MEV they've been able to earn a lot of rewards So is there are some validators out there that have earned more awards in the last few months Then people who have been a validator since Genesis have have earned And that's just based on pure chance at the end the day as I said it's random There's no way to tell if you're gonna when you're gonna propose a block There's no way to force yourself to propose a block The only way you can tell when you're gonna propose a block is when your time comes basically when you've got that window It's not very long, but you have a window of seeing that you're up next to propose a block But other than that you don't know when it's gonna happen, so it's always just cool to see the percent chances here But yeah, it seems that you need around 60 validators to have a hundred percent chance of proposing a block each each day here All right, so there's a new LSD that was announced well I mean, it's like a pseudo LSD called the liquid collective Which is an enterprise grade liquid staking protocol is they're building themselves as designed to meet the needs of institutions So I did say that post merge we're probably gonna see a lot more institutional staking come up But I don't expect these institutions to a lot of them to I guess like spin up their own infrastructure Because what liquid staking is doing here a lot sorry what liquid collective is doing here is that they're actually partnering with a bunch of Different companies so they're partnered with coinbase and kraken as integrators They've partnered with figment coinbase cloud and staked as validators, and they're going to be providing of LSDs or liquid staking I should say for a eighth and and dots and a VAX Yeah, so And then if you go down they're also going to be issuing a LSD called LS eighth so it is technically an LSD But as I said like they're delegating that I guess infrastructure to people who already know how to run the infrastructure But still cool to see more competition as I said plenty of times the two things We need is more competition and withdrawals being enabled to further decentralize and distribute stake out there at least those are the two Okay, they're not the only two things, but like that they're some of the biggest things And I've talked about it a lot already, so I'm not gonna rehash it here But I mean some people have asked you know What is an enterprise grade liquid staking protocol designed for institutions or basically? It's using enterprise and enterprise enterprise grade infrastructure which is offered by things like coin, but we buy arm services like coinbase and Kraken and Marketing and selling the product to institutions now There is a popular joke that on Twitter the Jen Spartan says it a lot about scamming the boomers into buying our bags like I feel like that's a very crude way of saying what this basically is because institutions on sell products to less sophisticated people or people who just don't care to get involved and understand the nuances of things and A lot of the time that is the older folk because they have the wealth they want to manage their wealth They want to put it into something where they don't have to worry about it And a lot of the times it's through these institutions Which then wrap the these other products up and just sell it to their cut to their Customers and earn a fee on it and all that and basically as the Jen Spartan says scamming the boomers out of their money And using them to kind of pump our bags so to speak But that's essentially what this stuff does and I don't think it's necessarily Like a negative or a bad thing or anything I think Obviously the more people we get involved more money we get involved with with Staking the better because obviously the more it that's take the higher the security of aetherium And it's even better if we can just get people staking eight without them even knowing it I think that's really cool But I still go back to what I said the other day or I think yesterday Where I obviously believe that we shouldn't let any one entity I have too much a share of the network Because that's obviously bad for decentralization So we can still obviously have a decentralized chain with institutions on it with big corporates and enterprises on it But we need we obviously need to make sure that that's that remains that way because without the social layer Enforcing this without technical upgrades to make it To encourage decentralization and all that sorts of stuff It could just end up very centralized down the line But right now I don't believe it is I think that you know even though there are centralization points right now with staking We're actually faring pretty good considering that We don't have withdrawals and the fact is that liquid staking is just very very popular Because it's so easy and staking with exchanges is so easy But I think we're doing quite well we can do a lot better and I'll keep pushing you a lot better But just cool to see more competition entering the game with liquid collective here All right, so open sea is now on arbitrum. This is funny. I thought open sea would be going to Optimism first, but it seems they've landed on arbitrum first I'm sure they're going to deploy to optimism as well, but this is a pretty big deal I believe open sea is not on that many chains right now. I think they're on obviously the main net polygon pos chain I think they're on Solana maybe but now they're on arbitrum and I don't think they're on anything else right now And it seems like they're going to just keep deploying to every chain. So it's not going to be a big deal as time goes on But I think it is a really big deal right now because arbitrum obviously has a big ecosystem They have a pretty big nft ecosystem as well So it's cool to see that obviously the most popular nft marketplace is now live on the arbitrum network So if you trade nfts on arbitrum, if you do anything nft related you'll obviously be very happy about this news and I certainly am as well because I think Arbitrum right now is like the lead for layer twos. They definitely seem to have the most organic Community, they definitely seem to have the best ecosystem right now Optimism is is is is behind but like not that far behind I think I would say they're a close second there with in terms of ecosystem But arbitrum just is very strong right now now that's going to change over time. It's not going to be set in stone I think obviously the the token wars hasn't haven't even started yet I mean only optimism really has a has a token out of arbitrum and optimism and And these other things like stark net and zk sync and stuff like that But the competition will definitely heat up but as it exists as it stands right now Arbitrum seems to be very very strong and and and and very much in the lead so cool to see open sea deployed there Now speaking of optimism. They also had an update today talking about Optimism quests which is basically their answer to arbitrum's Odyssey it seems very similar here but optimism quest is a guided exploration of the ecosystem that allows users to earn nfts while exploring Optimism apps and there's a thread Around here of how to get involved. I think this is really cool. Honestly, I think that just because arbitrum did odyssey, which is Obviously similar to to this doesn't mean that optimism can't do their own branded version of it in their own flavor of it Because I think that we should be encouraging As many people as possible to onboard into these layer twos in whatever way possible So i'm excited about this and I think the nfts actually look really cool as well. Like, uh, they're little about I mean, they're kind of like look like game boys slash tv with uh different I guess logos and different designs depending on the different Applications there. So I think that's pretty cool Uh, but I just I love seeing adoption of layer twos that that just gets me going that's for sure like layer one protocol theory Is still my favorite thing but like layer twos doing innovative and cool things like optimism quest and arbitrum odyssey Is definitely what gets me out of bed and gets me excited about this ecosystem So you can go check this out at app.optimism.io slash quests. I'll link that in the youtube description below for you So speaking of layer twos in fura announced today that devs on stark net can now connect via the inferior api So this is basically inferior supporting stark net which is a very popular platform So this is basically inferior supporting stark net which is cool to see obviously as i've mentioned plenty of times Infrastructure is incredibly important to these layer twos And as I mentioned the other day inferior is actually planning to decentralize as well. So I feel Less bad about promoting inferior than I once did because I didn't feel bad about promoting it But obviously I knew it was centralized so I'd promote other solutions over and it's still centralized right now But because inferior has is moving towards a decentralized model I'm getting more and more excited about the fact that inferior has such a large user base and it's not going to be stuck in Centralization hell it's actually going to be decentralized We don't know when that is, but hopefully it's sooner rather than later, but I feel better about Kind of like talking about them now and talking about them in their in their future But cool to see them supporting stark net here. The stock in the ecosystem is still growing It's you know, the funny thing is the styner ecosystem has a lot of apps on there But I think a lot of them feel like hackathon ish apps. They're not really fully fledged apps just yet There's more and more of them coming online But it's good to see that the different approaches here where obviously on arbitrum and optimism a lot of the apps are copies of a theorem Layer one which is fine It's exactly what we want to see because obviously a theorem layer one is not where end users are going to be sitting long term But on stark net it seems there's a lot of different apps on there a lot of different experimentation happening on there So I like those differences between the different ecosystems there All right, so another bridge I guess Protocol or project was announced today from a succinct lab succinct labs where they published this blog post Talking about interoperability. Oh, sorry. It's titled towards the endgame of blockchain Interoperability with proof of consensus so they've been working on this for a little while here and they say the current state of interoperability is very centralized Popular multi-sig based designs placing men's trust on a small group of people It's critical that the future of interrupt is as secure decentralized and uncensorable as the underlying blockchains bridged between and they talk about ibc which is part of cosmos and why ibc like mechanism on earth won't work because Computation is too expensive and and also the intricacies of the evm here But and then they say, you know What if we use succinct proofs to make verifying consensus efficient similar to how zk snarks are helping zk roll up team scale Execution by implementing zk evms. What if we were able to use snarks to scale verification of consensus? So you can read this thread and the blog post for full details here There is a bit of a debate in the comments as as well About what kind of like what this is and how it actually differs and how it works and how centralized versus decentralized it is So you can go check that out check out the blog post as well. I haven't fully that digested it yet So I can't really explain like i'm five But it seems cool seems promising always cool to see new bridge designs and more innovation in the bridge space But i'll have to keep an eye on it and uh get back to you guys once I can explain it like i'm five like you're five All right. So some ens news ens controller v2 is ready for review This adds features that pay independent developers saves up to 40 on gas costs and allows simpler one transaction registrations And the coolest bit according to alex vandasand is it's all built by an independent team So that is quite cool actually So you can read the blog post for full details here Obviously, I think what i'm most excited about is the 40 gas cost savings and the simpler one transaction registrations because I think those two things have been Something that people have knocked ens for uh for a while now that it was too complex to to do a registration It took too long and obviously the gas gas costs, you know, 40 savings on gas cost is obviously very huge here So i'll link this in the youtube description below for you to check out Uh, and I just want to finish up here because i'm coming up on time last update is uh one out of sismo today So they're releasing a zk another zk badge for sismo, which is the sismo contributor zk badge Which is central to their governance through private voting the community will help us create curate bad badges So you can meet yours now at this link here And this thread talks more about uh badge curation So just a quick recap on what sismo is here and also disclaimer that i'm investor in sismo But what they are is that they're basically issuing these things called zk badges for reputation aggregation and privacy preserving access control Explain like i'm five version of that is imagine you have and i've explained this before on the refill But just to recap for people imagine you have a thousand arva tokens on your cold storage address that you don't want to expose To the world, uh, you couldn't mint yourself a badge that proves that you have a that you own a thousand arva tokens But you don't have to reveal what address those arva tokens are on and the badge using zk magic is proof of that So the protocol knows the other protocol knows that you own That 1000 arva it just doesn't know where you own it and you can use that badge obviously in governance to to to vote on The uh governance proposal as if you had 1000 arva in a different wallet so you can basically separate your public wallet So I could separate sassel.eth from all of my private wallets all of my cold storage wallets All of my cold storage wallets, but still interact with defi interact with governance interact with uh nfts all these sorts of stuff Without revealing anything else that i've got in my cold storage and private storage, which I think is obviously very cool That's why I backed this team because I think what they're building Is very much lit and needed and falls in with the privacy stuff that I definitely am very passionate about But you can go meet your contributor badge if you're eligible links in the youtube description, but that's going to be it for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet Give it a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter join the disco channel, and i'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone

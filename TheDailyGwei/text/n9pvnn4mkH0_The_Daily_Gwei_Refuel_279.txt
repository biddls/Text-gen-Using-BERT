 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the daily way refuel worry cap the latest news the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host Anthony sassano and today's the 23rd of December 2021. All right, everyone. Let's get into it So I forgot to cover this a couple of days ago Loopering or I guess yesterday Loopering announced that the release of their L2 only Counterfactual wallet plus direct to loop ring L2 fiat on ramps which are finally here as they say now in layman's terms What this basically is is it basically allows you to not have to create a L1 smart contract wallet Using loop rings iOS app and you can buy bass bypass that all together and you'll have an L2 only wallet until you want to create an L1 wallet right to Kind of go back to L1. So loop rings calling it a try before you buy it option Which I think is actually a pretty good way of putting it because what this does and what? Counterfactual kind of like what a counterfactual wallet actually is it means it's basically creating the wallet for you at kind of like layer 2 And then kind of like reserving your spot on layer 1 at least I think that's the correct way to think about it Right so that later when you want to create it on layer 1 you can Using the same address that you have on layer 2, of course, so this is super cool As I said, it's only available on iOS right now, but Android is coming soon here, which is really really awesome And you can find a full description here of I guess like what what's going on here the benefits the drawbacks you can see here there's like a Few drawbacks here where an L2 only wallet won't give you things like social recovery or daily limits or locking your account or anything like That but the cost you created it's much less But if you kind of like create the L1 wallet as well, you'll get all these kind of additional Benefits here, but it costs I mean that's like 30x more gas it cost 10k gas Just for the L2 wallet and 300k gas for the L1 wallet and the L2 wallet So yeah, but also this fiat on-ramp So RAM network is providing direct fiat on-ramps to loop ring now, which is really cool to see I remember I discussed yesterday about how I want to see you know fiat on-ramps everywhere and all these L2s whether they be the kind of like standalone L2s or the Generalized ones or anything like that. I want to see them everywhere But yeah, this is a major announcement from from loop ring cap You know funny thing is counterfactual wallets or counterfactual smart contracts in general has been something that's been discussed for a very long time I think maybe 2017 maybe earlier than that. I remember a mean from from spank chain actually put out a blog post Maybe it was 2018 talking about this and at the time I was like, okay So this is really cool, but I didn't kind of like see the practical applications of it back then But you know, I definitely do now and I think that it's going to be seeing more and more useless time goes on and you know Looper just continue to kill it on with the L2 game. The thing is It's funny because they're not like an app specific L2, but they're like a generalized L2 They have their own ecosystem where they have a bunch of different products on their zk roll-up, right? They have the wallet They have the exchange they have the loop ring pays, you know They have the NFT stuff going on there with you know, people people are kind of like, um Creating rumors right now that loop ring might be partnering with GameStop you know the thing is I don't actually think it's too far-fetched to to kind of like think that because The former head of business development at loop ring Matt fine stone actually is the head of crypto edge at GME now GameStop now So it's not too far-fetched I think that's the connection people are making but I don't have any kind of like insider information there anything like that I mean Matt is a friend a very good friend, but You know, I don't know what's going on there. I haven't I haven't actually spoken to him in a little while now Now now that I think about it, but yeah now loop ring just continues to kill it with the L2 game Just slowly but surely and I'm really really glad to see that they brought out their counterfactual wallet release today So Uniswap v3 is finally live on polygons POS chain This was I guess like something that happened over the last month or so I believe and I remember going through each of the voting stages with you guys on the review I thought it was pretty important because uni swap as I've mentioned before is only on arbitrum optimism and if our one main net and Going on to the polygon POS chain is a big step forward for them I I believe right and I really want to see you news up on the other l2s as well and the other kind of You know, maybe friendly side chains I don't know how many there actually are like x-day and merged and created this gnosis chain thing Which I've had a few people Asked me about and I've discussed it before on the refuel I they call it like an incentivized test now, but like I don't know I I still don't really see the point of it But I'm not gonna get into that now but just really really cool to see that uniswap v3 is live on polygon because I Mean there are other amm's on polygon like polygons POS chain like quickswap But the thing is is that as I mentioned before? Uniswap is just so dominant right they have stood dominant brand Everyone knows everyone knows how to use it and LP and trade and everything like that. They trust it, which is a big thing So people are going to be using this in kind of like droves on Polygon's POS chain because they have so many active users on there already and just deploying uniswap there is going to be amazing So I can't I mean, I can't wait to see some stats around this. It's only been I mean less than 24 hours I think so. There's not going to be that many stats on this just yet But I can't wait to personally see this the kind of like metrics around this and also to see how the the growth compares to Their other deployments right at end of the day because I mean albertra and optimism are awesome But I believe that the polygon POS chain actually has more users or at least more active kind of like addresses By it by a by a long shot because they actually did I mean polygon actually did liquidity mining originally to get kind of traction They've kind of tapered that off over the last few months But they do have a lot of users and a lot of apps on there now So they have their own kind of like ecosystem that's going on there. So that makes a lot of sense for sure So yeah, I'm very much looking forward to seeing some metrics around that there and next up We have a slingshot who announced today that they are supporting uni swap v3 on polygon So you can use slingshot to trade through uni swap You can just go to this link here to bling to the usual description, but great to see I mean, it's already been degraded. I mean that was really quick, right? I think there was a few other things I've got integrated really quickly as well and it just shows how fast these things move Could you imagine something like this launching in the traditional finance space and then having to get like everyone to support it? It would take months if you know if not years Whereas in aetherium land or in crypto land if you launch something everyone it was just cause it's all open Everything's kind of like smart contract base and open basically an open API Everyone can just tap into it build on it integrate with it on the day, which is really really cool so yeah, really cool to see slingshot already supporting the Kind of uni swap v3 deployment on polygon last bit of polygon news is that they announced today that opera or opera Oprah, um, the web browser is going to be powered by polygon soon So the browser will integrate polygon in their web 3 ready browser and inbuilt crypto wallet in q1 2022 so that's another massive kind of like partnership for polygon there. It's actually a pretty big day for polygon today You know, I know I spoke about them yesterday and I put a tweet out saying Hey yesterday, they've got a bit of heat over where I said polygon deserves to be in the top 10 But you guys know I'm an advisor to polygon and I've been so bullish on them You know for a very long time like even before I was an advisor I was really kind of like bullish on the ecosystem that they were kind of like building and you know I knew about it before and I was like this is gonna be huge, right? So yeah, I know I talk about them a lot, but that's only because they're doing so much I mean if there's any team within aetherium that he's just absolutely killing it across like every vertical is definitely polygon But I'm gonna I'm gonna leave it at that. You can definitely check out more information about this partnership It'll be linked in the YouTube description below So the aetherium foundation put out their final year updates around the EF supported teams roundup of 2021 From 15 plus teams, so it's worth the rate so you can see here. That's all of the aetherium foundation supported teams basically Detailing what they're doing Recapping what they've done, you know in 2021. This is a pretty long lengthy blog post You can see here all the different types of teams that are supported teams working on consensus research and development The ecosystem support program aetherium.org. I'm just going down the list here geth form verification Z KVM all these sort of sorts of stuff, right? So this is really really cool to see this updates and there's links to all these other different things here and this really is um, probably one of the best summaries of stuff that's happening within the aetherium foundation kind of like As a group because I know that transparency into the aetherium foundation isn't really there Not many people actually know what they do I think I would summarize what they're doing kind of like two major things they provide funding for these teams and they also kind of like try to push out all the functions of I Guess like what a theorem is trying to do into the public domain and trying to kind of like support that through You know public goods funding trying to support it through grants and sorry special grants like the ones that I mentioned the other day the East to client incentive program where they gave a bunch of eighth to client teams and then they run, you know They run the devcon event as well, which is the biggest a theorem event of the year Unfortunately, we haven't had one for two years now, but you know, we might have one next year but yeah, I highly recommend going and giving this blog post to read and just checking out all the links and everything because this will Be your best way to learn about all the kind of like less talked about aetherium things that things that people just don't like, you know talk about on Twitter too much and and and don't Kind of like pay much attention to because it's very I guess I would call it low lower level stuff where it's a lot of Um a lot of stuff that he's not kind of like got bells and whistles on it, but he's necessary work So definitely go check this out. It'll be linked in the YouTube description below So a cross protocol announced today that they now support round-trip bridging So you can now send assets from L1 to L2 and back again The L1 to L2 bridging is accomplished by an integration with the canonical bridges of optimism, arbitrum and a bobber network This is really really cool to see just more kind of like bridge infrastructure being built out I really think that in addition to 2022 being like the year of L2 It's also going to be the year of multi chain infrastructure and that obviously includes L2, you know to me It's always funny when people talk about like the L2 world or sorry the multi chain world and then they kind of like You know talking about like other L1 and things like that like for me It's just like L2s right but also the other L1s and all these kind of like bridges connecting all these sorts of things So I do think 2022 is going to be the year of L2 the year of cross chain cross L2 infrastructure Not just bridges, but those arbitrary message relays that I've spoken about and other kind of supporting infrastructure around that Even block explorers and stuff like that for the actual bridges or bridge explorers, whatever you want to call them Obviously very important and very critical there. So yeah great to see this update from across protocol Definitely go check out the blog post for more info on that So metamask is teasing another feature again part of their Christmas feature at CR So you can see here that they are working on the next iteration of the AIP 1559 interface Now this is just a teaser. You can't really see much what that's going through You can basically see this little screenshot where they seem to have like a much more simplified interface And they're saying that's going to come with improved gas estimations great new UI and simplified advanced settings This is great to see because I know that with metamask a lot of people have been complaining not just about their 1559 integration from an interface standpoint But also just generally with metamask So it's great to see them focusing more on on the UI of the kind of like mobile app Mobile app and the kind of like Chrome and Firefox extension Because at the end of the day as much as kind of we all complain about metamask. We all use it right? We all use it pretty religiously. We use it as a pass-through for hardware wallets It's what we know we know it's kind of like secure. It's been around for a while It's it's supported by pretty much like every web 3 app out there So there's a reason we all use it right so but still we do want it to have like a better UI as time goes on Especially around things like um one of the things that we're doing right now is we're doing a lot of 1.5 5 9 and gas estimation because that's something that people toggle free pretty frequently Depending on how fast you want to get your transaction in for me actually most of my transaction since 1.5 5 9 went live I haven't had to actually touch these settings But depending on the hot type of user you are you may or may not need to do that So we'll keep tabs on this. I'm sure they'll bring out more information about this very very soon So speaking of 1.5 5 9 pin tail put out a really great article today having a look at if 1.5 5 9 fulfilled its objectives and the TLDR is that the transition is still underway after 1.5 5 9 you can see here that legacy Transactions still make up a significant part of main and main net activity So in green is the 1.5 5 9 transactions in orange is legacy equivalent Transactions and then in blue is like a legacy transaction. So it is trending down The the legacy transactions, I think I think what it's like 35% just eyeballing it here I mean 1.5 5 9 transactions seem to be dominating more and those who are using 1.5 5 9 type 2 transactions are enjoying Significantly lower variability which in kind of like fees which means a more efficient gas market now I've explained this to you guys before is that but that was the kind of benefit of 1.5 5 9 is that it would Smoothen out the gas phase it wouldn't reduce them It would smoothen them out which would lead to a small net reduction in in the best case there So you can see here that's our pin tail give it Gavin gives an example where they say for a concrete example consider tornado cash transactions which averaged 6.4 percent cheaper when type 2 transactions are used so This is the little bit of kind of like gas things I was talking about where I think it's anywhere from like 5 to 15 percent that you could have Or could have kind of like a reduction here I remember coinbase had a reduction of about 7 percent or something like that across all of their transactions So it was I mean it wasn't negligible But it wasn't like a massive saving and that's why I always said that 1.5 5 9 wouldn't substantially reduce gas fees But because it smoothed out the gas phase it would lead to lower, you know, slightly lower transaction phase Which is always really really good to say. So yeah, I mean the tail day is that 1.5 5 9 definitely fulfilled its objectives Not only did it provide us with a fee burn Which is obviously one of its objectives The other one was smoothing out the gas fee market and making it much more efficient and much better in general I don't know about you guys, but I felt it as I said before I haven't had to really adjust many transactions since 1.5 5 9 where 1.5 5 9 went live Because of the fact that the estimation is just much much better and you're usually included in the next block or two Which is really really cool So yeah Definitely go give this article a read because it goes into much more detail about this and provides a lot of proof Which I always love because pins I mean pin tails articles. I've been reading for years now I remember pin tails article on uni swap was was the one that actually got me to understand uni swap So this is a lengthy one a 38 minute read on 1.5 5 9 but if you really want to dig in and really want to see that it actually You know with research backing up all the statements that it actually improved the gas fee market Definitely check this out because I know know there was a bit of fight around this So people said Oh 1.5 5 9 increased gas fees and it didn't actually do what it was saying It was gonna do it was all just about the fee burn Well now you have basically irrefutable proof that that's incorrect and you have kind of like all this research to back it up So very very glad to see these from pin tail and thanks to them for putting this out so Famous basketball player Shaq Updated his name on Twitter today to Shaq dot F dot E. I guess You know The funny thing is I always used to say this guy's name wrong because I don't I don't follow a basketball and I know this guy Is pretty popular in the US I used to say his name is Shaq and so one day someone called it out for Called me out for and I was like, what are you saying man? They're like, well, who's Shaq? I'm like Shaq the basketball player and they're like what you mean Shaq and I'm like, oh, oh, is that how you say it? I'm really bad at pronouncing words a lot of the time and I tend to change how I pronounce them because of the fact that I listen so many different voices like sometimes I'll say data and then sometimes I say data like my my fiance is always But whenever I say I say they say data she's like it's data. I'm like, ah, okay It's just it's just funny how like that that happens. I remember when I visited the US I started saying water as In a different way in the kind of like American way I can't even remember how to say it right now, but it's funny how that that plays out But anyway, that's a little bit of a tangent. It's just really cool to say this because this makes Shaq the number one I guess like account on Twitter with a dot eighth name as his Twitter name So, I don't know if this is actually him who did this or his kind of like intern that controls his Twitter account Not sure. I don't follow him. So I don't know if it's actually him that's controlling his Twitter account But look at a NS taking over the world, right? This is really awesome There's actually a leaderboard that shows you or kind of like all the people you can go here to eat leaderboards at XYZ and it Actually shows you the leaderboard of people with Their Twitter name is an ENS. So you can see that people like Trey Trey songs Drake Bell from Jake A Drake and Josh and I mean I just seen famous youtuber Boredale a mask I mean There's so many people that have a lot of followers with with an ENS name now and you can see that that Shaq here has 15.5 million followers, which is a 1.7 million more than Trey songs Which makes him number one and you can just scroll down the list to see it all I think the last time I checked I was like one sorry top 50 still. Yeah, I'm number 42, which is which is pretty cool I mean, it's still top 50 but it's hilarious to me that there are people like above me that Are not kind of like a native people or crypto native people they're either just they're doing it because they want to get more involved in the web 3 kind of like Vision or more and more involved with aetherium or they're doing it for I don't know But some actually I actually think you know, I'm not sure I mean there's lots of different reasons where people would do this But I like to think that it's because they've kind of like looked into web They looked into theorem a theorem and be like, oh cool. I can get my own kind of I guess domain name So to speak right I can get my own My own name that attached to my own address and I can just send people this instead of hand sending to my address so and I actually think that ENS is the best non financial application that we have on aetherium and I mean just best probably just even the best application in general that we have to show people the power of this Technology and say to people look you can have a wallet That allows you to do all your financial transactions and all your other kind of stuff Without a bank and you can also attach your own kind of name to it so that you don't have to have all these funky characters you can just attach You know sassle dot e to it and then you'll be able to kind of send funds there because I don't know how it works In your countries, but in my country in Australia, I saw the same people a bunch of numbers for my bank account details They do have subsystems now where they allow you to send like your email and things like that but it's not all the banks support it and it can get messy and murky and then you still want to make sure that everything's Okay, and then you have to kind of like ask them for it We're asking for their account details and stuff like that Whereas on a theorem if you want to make sure someone's ENS name is actually correct You can just put it into either scan and you'll spit out the address for you So and some apps will actually automatically do that as well as part of the integrations But yeah, cool to see Shaq kind of supporting If yeah, I love this dot 8 right because like immediately people see that like what's the teeth and then they'll just go google it And you know and they'll find a Guinness to find a theorem and they'll get more involved. So it's a really great marketing vehicle I think All right. Finally here we have element finance or announcing a new primitive for grants and rewards called the optimistic grants and rewards program So I think the TLDR of the optimistic approach is essentially that they're going to be taken that they're going to They say yeah We think that it's important for the element community to push forward and my new funding experiments with the new perimeters at their disposal To make the grants process more open and efficient This is why we're pioneering optimistic grants a new structure that assumes the best out of its grantees by offering the tools and empowerment to deliver on its grant outline in a permissionless fashion So this is really cool because it basically means that these teams will get grants and basically it'll be a kind of like, okay We assume and we're optimistic that you're going to actually put these this money to work You're actually going to build something really cool and create new primitives and create value for the kind of like crypto community So we're not gonna like micromanage you or anything like that We're just gonna kind of like give you the the money here But yeah, anyway, definitely go check out this blog post for more details on this It was it was an interesting kind of raid and I thought okay this can this can work But at the same time I can see how I can go kind of like or E Right if people can just run away with the money and stuff like that But you know, I don't think many people are gonna do that Especially if they've got like their reputations tied to it and things like that I think this is actually going to be really cool experiment to watch play out But anyway, go give this blog post to read for more details on on that there And before I wrap it up for today is actually one thing I wanted to quickly talk about that wasn't related to to the element Finance announcement. It was just something else. I don't know I don't have a tweet for this or anything a lot of people have been kind of like asking me lately how to get involved with kind of like early stage investments private investments angel investments things like that because on the refuel I often say I'm an investor in this project, right? I mean, I forgot to say I'm actually an investor in element finance But the reason I say this is because I want to be transparent with you guys I want to disclose these things because I don't want you guys to just be kind of like seeing me kind of like I guess Talk about something or shill something and not know that I have a financial stake in it And now I have a personal website that I'm working to spin up I've been working on this for kind of like a couple of months now But it's just been keep getting pushed back and then with the move and everything got pushed back even more I'm having to get that out there because that'll list every single team that I've invested in all the projects I'm advising all the tokens that I hold all that sort of stuff there But what I want to say is that I'm not saying it to brag or anything like that I'm not trying to kind of pump my bags or anything I just want to be really really transparent with you guys and then you know You know people asking me like how you know How can I kind of participate in this and I've answered this in one of the AMA's before? But that you know The shortened suite of it is that to be invited to these kind of like private investment rounds or to be an angel investor You need to meet kind of like two requirements one There's the financial requirement which is an which is a law that he sets by various countries called accredited investor laws This is out of the control of the team. So in the US in a the accredited investor law stipulates that you need to have a net worth of at least a million dollars or you need to Have in have made twenty fifty thousand plus dollars two years in a row as a kind of like income That obviously locks out nine point nine nine percent of people I think they are the worst laws the worst financial laws in existence. I absolutely hate them I thought something I could do about it. I would unfortunately I have no say in those kind of things, especially not in the US I'm not sure totally sure how it works in Australia I think we have similar laws here, but you know I just don't have any power to kind of change that there unfortunately And then the second way you kind of like invite or the second requirement is that you need to kind of like bring something of value To the project right you need to kind of like like in my case For example, what I bring of value is the fact that I have a large audience right? Like I have Twitter following I do my youtube show. I obviously the refuel I tell you guys about things I can help it there the teams with marketing with community staff. I have a lot of experience I have a huge network within aetherium. So that's kind of like what I offer to to these teams now There's a lot of other people that they bring on as well that kind of offer similar things like a bankless guys For example, same sort of situation as me They've got that network and they kind of like get invited for reasons like that And there's a there's a bunch of other people too, right? There's lots of people who have their own different sets of skills. Some people are really good developers and really experienced ones They'd love to have them on board some people are part of Or or at least a part of teams that they want to kind of like work with so it's better to get them as investors Because then you're aligned with them and all that sort of stuff there So those are the two main requirements and then I had someone ask in the discord channel today and I've had other people ask this before if I would set up like a Kind of like fund and take people's money and then invest kind of like in these teams with that I'm gonna be honest with you guys. No No for many different reasons the number one reason is that that's a lot of risk for me a lot of legal risk a lot of lot of paperwork a Lot of just like screwing around a lot of I would have to I don't even I don't even know where to start Especially in Australia, I wouldn't know where to start there But there's a lot of just screwing around in that kind of like arena there and a lot of the time when times when I invest I invest as myself. I don't invest as part of a group and that might you know that might kind of like Scare off kind of on these teams and the teams would be like, oh we don't want you know We only want you we don't want like kind of your kind of like I guess syndicate you could call it or something like that So it's not trying me trying to be like a selfish and keep all the you know the stuff for myself But at the end of the day I just don't want to take on the insane amount of kind of like legal Risk for what I view as little reward and you know I've been approached by kind of like funds in the ecosystem before to become an LP for them or or a limited partner where I Would essentially kind of like refer them deals and then they would give me a cut of that and I've turned that down Because I just don't want to have people kind of like relying on me for that sort of stuff either I don't want the fund expecting me to bring them all these deal flow all the time and Then kind of like I get upset at me if I don't bring them any deals for a couple months or something like that I I hate that kind of pressure. So I didn't want to do that either I'm just happy being a solo guy like I'm happy just investing on my own and things like that But at the same time I also try to give back as much as possible I mean everything I do at the deli way is free the deli ways of true public good. I make no money from it I mean, okay, the only money I make is when you guys donate to me on get coin But like I do no ads or anything like that and the money you guys donate to me on get coin after I pay my taxes On it just goes back into buying eighth and that eighth is never getting sold. So Like I mean, I've told you this they told you guys this stuff before But yeah, I I didn't want to get too ranty here But I just wanted to explain kind of like my reasoning behind all of that and how I would love for you guys to be Able to to kind of like have these opportunities as well But it's more than just a wealth requirement It really is that kind of like social requirement or that requirement of kind of like having a network or bringing something of value or doing whatever and you know, The thing is is that you can actually join a lot of these projects early on in their discord channel Whatever and start adding value and build up yourself over time And get to a point where you may earn more tokens than angel investors got from their angel investments And you did that by giving your time instead of your money that's happened plenty of times before I mean my angel investment checks are relatively small for a lot of things that I put money into and you can probably end up getting a lot more tokens by just Contributing to the early stage project there. But yeah, I think the last thing I'll say on this as well. Is that Guy like I understand how people feel I used to think like this too back when I wasn't getting these kind of deals But the thing is is that like I started from from zero like I had no In connection to this industry at all before I joined it. I worked my kind of like way up over the years I you know tried to try really hard. I worked my house off all that sort of stuff This is not a sob store anything like this, right? This is just Amy explaining to you guys what I did to get to my position today. I didn't just happen overnight I had no I didn't have anyone kind of like Kind of like carrying me on their shoulders I did pretty much most of it on my own right and I still kind of like try to keep my my name in the Ecosystem and still try to grow myself and things like that And that's what I suggest you guys do if you want to access these opportunities if you want to have more opportunity in general within This ecosystem you need to make a name for yourself. You can do it as an a non You don't even have to do it as a public figure There are plenty of anons out there who have a following people love them They they do a really a lot of really cool stuff in this ecosystem Some of them even found projects and go on to be billion dollar protocols You don't have to be doxed but at the same time you do have to put in the work You can't just expect to have access to all the opportunity in the world if you're not willing to put in the work And if you know if you want to be a passive investor if you if you don't have the time or you don't care to be Really involved you can do that. You can just buy other things on the public markets, right? There's plenty of opportunity out there still for people who just want to be like in the background investor And there's been lots of things that have gone like 10 to 100 X on public markets that you could have gotten involved in Just this year. So anyway, I'm gonna end it there I just wanted to kind of like go through that sort of stuff because I've had people ask this to me a few a few Times before but yeah ending it there for today I noticed that my camera's going out of focus a few times in this episode apologies for that I'm gonna get that fixed hopefully for the next one But anyway, thank you for listening Be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet give the video a thumbs up subscribe to the newsletter Join the discord channel and I'll catch you all tomorrow. Thanks everyone

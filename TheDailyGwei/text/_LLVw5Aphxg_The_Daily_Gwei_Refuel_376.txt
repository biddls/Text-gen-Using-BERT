 Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the deadly way refuel where we cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host. Anthony sasano and tays the 1st of june 2022 All right, everyone, let's get into it. So the op token finally dropped over the last 24 hours Obviously you've all heard of this by now. So not not much to go through there I'm sure a lot of you have claimed your a drops at this stage, you know Maybe you're delegating them to to one of the kind of like governance delegates. Maybe you sold some or all of it So maybe you traded it back to eith. I don't know. It's totally up to you what you do with your airdrop That's for sure I did have a few people kind of like asking me what to do with the airdrop and kind of like what my opinion was On the op token value guys I'm never going to comment directly on a token except eith like eith is the only token or coin that I make an exception for because I have I have eith bags obviously, but I don't plan to sell my eith so I don't feel bad for uh, kind of like I guess you could say shilling eith, you know Because i'm not going to be dumping on anyone so to speak and i'm not kind of like just talking My book so to speak. I mean I am in a way but it's kind of different, right? Plus it's kind of hard for me not to comment on eith since this whole channel revolves around ethereum and eith, right? um So in saying that i'm not going to comment on the token value also because I got a rather large airdrop and I also am The investor in optimism as part of their series b so just wouldn't be responsible for me to do that So i'm not going to do that. Um, but you know I I I um, I commend you for trying to get me to to commit to something I'm not and look I don't think anyone knows where the price is going to go There's been a really a bunch of really great discussions in the discord channel So if you do want to give people's opinions on what the price is going to do whether you should hold it or not Definitely you can have those conversations in the channel. I'm never going to stop you guys from doing that Um, but i'm personally not going to to kind of like answer, you know much questions or questions around that And you guys know my general view on tokens, right where I basically say that there's a bunch of criteria that you need to look at When judging tokens, um, and you know that applies to every token so I I still got to um Do that standalone video I spoke about where I go through my you know criteria of kind of like how I judge tokens and how I decide What's good to buy what's not good to buy and stuff like that like um, but not maybe not kind of like talking about specific tokens We're just talking from like a high level. But anyway enough about the uh, the token price speculative side of things uh now that the op token is live I guess we could officially say that L2 summer has started. I mean today's the first day of summer in the northern hemisphere, uh, I believe um Depending where you are like it's kind of weird different countries or different places in the world have like different start Official start dates so to speak i've always just kind of like said, okay Well, june july august is like um winter from where I am. It's it's it's very cold here actually right now in melbourne It's freezing last night and it's funny that the um, the top part of the world is uh, he's in summer But yeah, northern kind of like hemisphere, uh is starting in summer here on the first of june technically the op token launched on may 31st, I guess i'm in Kind of like the us and europe, but uh for me it was the first of june So yeah, l2 summer has kicked off. I'm sure we're gonna see more tokens coming out relatively soon You know, it's funny I used to say on the refuel that I thought optimism would be One of the last teams to issue their token and they kind of like I mean honestly I think that they were positioned for that but then they just did a 180 Uh all of a sudden and we're like no we're gonna be the first ones to do it, right? We're gonna be one of the first l2s or first out of the kind of like major ones to do it Obviously polygon already has a token with matic right? So that there's no token coming from from there. It's already live. Um Arbitrum doesn't have one zk sync doesn't have one stalker doesn't have one scroll doesn't have one, you know I mean and there are some others like immutable and loop ring But if you're talking about the major kind of like generalized platforms, none of them have it except Optimism, uh and kind of like polygon, right? So we'll have to see how how that kind of like shakes out over the coming months see which teams goes next You know and kind of like how optimism uses the op token to incentivize growth as well I think if anything is going to push the other layer 2 platforms to do tokens faster than they otherwise would have it's seeing Optimism, uh have a lot of success with their token Through incentives and things like that, right? So we're gonna have to see how that shakes out But if you want to keep track of the actual kind of like airdrop So this is only the first airdrop that optimism has kind of like done as part of the op token distribution There will be ones going in the future But if you want to keep track of op airdrop one hill dobby has put together a great dune analytics dashboard that you can kind Of view here. I'll link it in the youtube description for you to do so so far 112 million Op has been claimed which is just over 50 percent. So 54 percent of the airdrop has been claimed 95 thousand addresses have claimed with kind of like 40,000 sorry 40 percent of the eligible ones doing it so you can see here kind of like what the what the claims look like Yeah, you know, it's funny. I wonder like how many people haven't claimed yet because they're waiting for kind of like the price to drop For tax reasons that's actually Something to consider for people who live in countries where an airdrop is considered Income at time of claim or receipt because right now my like I haven't claimed my airdrop yet So my airdrop sitting in the contract still that's technically not mine yet, right? The tokens belong to the contract I guess I can claim them, but I don't have them yet. So I haven't incurred any kind of like Taxable events, but if I was to claim it and it was to go to my wallet Then immediately at the price that I claim it at say the op token price is a dollar fifty I would have to calculate how much tax I owe on the entire amount, right? How much income tax I owe on the entire amount and then cash out op to pay for that or cover it with some other way So the funny thing is for me personally I'm actually waiting waiting to July 1st to claim so July 1st is when the financial year resets for Australia Our financial year is July 1st to June 30th and that'll kind of like reset my income and then I'll just claim then and And kind of I guess like pay the pay whatever taxes owed from there rather than claiming now And you know if I claim now I have to pay basically half of it as tax 47% as tax right which I don't want to do because I personally want to hold the op tokens I want to delegate them to kind of like governance But I would have to probably sell a decent chunk of them to cover the tax bill So I think there's a lot of people in my position Maybe they're not gonna wait till July 1st, but maybe they're gonna wait till the price drops more before kind of like Before before claiming in order to kind of like minimize their their tax obligations I'm not sure it depends where you are depends how a drops? Treated in depending on the jurisdiction that you're in But yeah, that might be a reason why there's still a lot of a job that haven't hasn't been claimed yet But we typically see this I mean with the ENS a drop. I believe there was there was a bunch of tokens I can't remember exactly how much like what percentage it was maybe five or ten percent or something like that someone can correct me in the comments maybe but Essentially that was kind of like not claimed, and then it was just sent back to the Treasury So then you know a similar thing might happen to optimism here I doubt you're gonna get to a hundred percent claimed like this It just doesn't really happen like that right because I'm sure there's people who have who have Left the ecosystem because the bull market subsided who used maybe use optimism or did one of the things that Entitled them to an airdrop and they just aren't around to know that they have an airdrop right like hell How sad is that like imagine you have an airdrop of even even if you only got like one of the smaller airdrops from op like five hundred or a thousand or P tokens right that's still worth like a Decent sum of money to kind of make most people out there And how sad is that you miss out on that if you kind of like left because you got bored of crypto because you're only Here for the bull market, and this is what I mean by playing those long-term games guys I'm not leaving during kind of like bear markets is because you there's still opportunity. There's still plenty of opportunity out there I mean even things like NFTs like I don't know if I don't think I spoke about on the refill But there was this goblin thing the other day this goblin and if T and everyone thought it was really dumb And it was really dumb right, but that pumped for some reason It's up to like I think it was like a free mint or like a very cheap mint now It's at like 6 8 per per goblin NFT And this is not me a kind of like endorsing that NFT or time you to go buy it or anything like that But it's just me using an example of does it just because it's a bear market doesn't mean there's not opportunity And there's actually I would argue more opportunity in a bear market than a bull market in terms of like positioning yourself for long-term Success and I've spoken about this plenty of times before but I want to keep on topic with the op stuff here So definitely check out this dashboard And I put out a tweet today I said you know friendly reminder the op airdrop is going to generate a lot of fear of a new on the optimism network with The proceeds from this fear of a new later being donated to public goods Which is turning d gens into regions now I want to show you guys a couple of charts that I should have gotten up before But I'm just going to get them up now bear with me so first chart We have here is basically what the daily transactions chart of the optimism network you can see massive spike right from people kind of like Using the the kind of like network to claim the airdrop because you have to claim it on layer 2 and then also we have The amount of fear of a new that's being generated now. This doesn't update very often So I don't think this is completely accurate but optimism has generated at least two hundred seventy thousand dollars worth of fear of a new today and All the profits or that's not so all the profit that goes from Basically the fear of a new here So it's not gonna be 270 thousands whatever the profit portion of that is is actually going to public goods funding So basically we have a lot of public goods funding coming through here And then also another thing that I wanted to kind of highlight was on ultrasound money the ultrasound dot money website here Optimism is actually in the top five Burners for today, so you can see here over the last 24 hours Optimism the OVM canonical transaction chain Which is basically the smart contract where the optimism network posted batches through from L2 has burned 113 8 and the optimism l2 gateway Which is the bridge contract in and out of optimism has burned 68 8 so in total if you kind of like calculate them together And put it out 170 it or something like that 180 which would put them at number third as kind of today's burners Which is very very cool to see and then you've also got like the OVM state commitment chain down here as well So another 40th Which would push them even up to number three like even above uni swap if you can't kind of like counts all of the Optimism related traffic here, and you could even say that some of the uni swap traffic was influenced by optimism too Because people trading the token right and the reason why I wanted to point this out was because there's been a bad narrative going around recently that's L2's a parasitic to Ethereum L1 and don't kind of like add value to ETH and I mean you guys know that that's a silly narrative But for those of you may not be aware of why all the L2's have to pay aetherium for security and they pay aetherium in ETH and most of that ETH gets burned as part of The way the trend a IP 1559 works on aetherium So like how can it be parasitic if it's literally adding value directly back to ETH like it There's no way around it The only way that these L2's cannot add value to ETH and be parasitic is if they settle somewhere else like if there's an L2 On another chain then obviously it's not selling on aetherium. It's not paying gas fees in aetherium It becomes parasitic, but if an L2 You know an L2 is living on aetherium is posting its transaction proofs And it's kind of like cold data and batches whatever else right to L2 to L1 aetherium Then it has to pay ETH in gas There's no way around that and there will never be a way around that unless we change the rules in the future Which I doubt the community would would agree to do that. You know they're not parasitic They're actually very very nice and very very additive as well and on that note I should kind of like point out this tweet from David Mihal here who said that optimism was responsible for 1.6% of all fee revenue paid on aetherium over the last 24 hours now I know this network activity is kind of like Not going to be the norm for optimism for a while because obviously there's a big spike due to the token launching But you can just imagine when this kind of activity is the norm and we get even more activity on these networks once They kind of like grow once we have better applications things like that on the network itself They could as I said before like it's going to take a while But eventually layer one block space would just be used up by layer twos and again It's not parasitic because they're paying for layer one block space in eight and eight is being burned So I think you know it's really cool to kind of like see that really cool to see it playing out as we kind of like envisioned that would and I love the fact that Kind of like um we have like clear evidence of this to show people now Rather than kind of like just saying it because at the end of the day doesn't matter if you say something And it's true people I think you know a lot of people think Like to you know see with their own eyes sort of thing so yeah It's great to see this here, and you can visit this website as well if you want L2 fees that info slash L1 fees I'll link it in the YouTube description and below And last up here on optimism side there was a bit of drama around how they do the launch here So basically they kind of like did a little thread of like what happened and kind of like why the I guess like the airdrop launch Was a bit. I don't know if I'd call it buggy, but a bit like What's the word I'm looking for it didn't run as ideally as we would want it to in Polina I had a bunch of great questions that they asked here saying you know why was the announcement not ready in time You have known for months the number of participants and the expected load based on previous airdrops Why do you seem surprised? Why was the public RPC not upgraded well in advance our post-mortem is essential now Jing from the Optimism team here the one of the co-founders responded to Polina and said you know you're right We focused on hardening the sequencer because that's where our anxiety was on that our Optimist killed it and the sequencer process 270 4000 transactions without a hitch however we vastly underestimated the RPC load which saw 10,000 requests a second our mistake was planning to for Average case claim volume and not worst case, but we don't waste mistakes retro public goods funding. I mean retrospective Incoming so the retrospective like a post-mortem is incoming that said I'm proud of how all the optimists handled the utter insanity of the last week So on that note where they aware we're talking about RPCs here I put out a tweet where I said ah so I see we're comparing RPC RPC issues with chains completely going offline Like they're the same thing CT has the collective intelligence of a goldfish So I've explained what RPCs are before but just to refresh you here an RPC is basically a Node that you kind of like connect to a piece of infrastructure that you connect to in order to relay your transactions on Ethereum you can do it through you in Fura or alchemy on optimism you have the kind of like official I Guess like optimism RPC, and then I think there are a couple others that may support optimism I think if you're a may supporter But anyway what ends up happening is that the RPC got overloaded and it's very hard to get Transactions through when that happens and this is this actually has happened on polygon before the polygon POS chain for those of you have experienced There but this is not You know this is not um akin to the chain going offline or the kind of like chain slowing down or having degraded performance because The chain worked fine as Jing said the sequencer itself processed all the transactions just fine if you could get them in so if you were for instance running your own RPC on for optimism on your own kind of like a Computer and talking to that and relating your transactions via that they would have gotten processed It's just that people use the public RPC and and that meant that kind of like it was overloaded and people couldn't get their Transactions in but the network itself ran fine, which is cool because it was a good stress test for the network So just kind of wanted to highlight That one there, but I think that's gonna be it on the optimism front. I think yes There's a related kind of thing that I wanted to talk about Related to optimism, but that was it for optimism kind of like for today, so hopefully you guys had fun It was nice. It was a nice little thing to wake up to in the morning today I look forward to the other l2 is doing their tokens as well so as I said I put out this tweet on a related note To optimism, but I said as an ecosystem We need to be building better and more sustainable applications that people actually want to use and actually get both social and monetary value out of none of the protocol level stuff like scaling matters If we don't create the ongoing demand to use it now There's a couple of things that I want to focus on with this tweet firstly is that? There's only a handful of applications that I would say have have achieved kind of like a sustainable moat or a sustainable kind of like product market fit within crypto today Of the top of the top of my head or within a theorem today off the top of my head I can think of three uni swap Ens and stable coins now you might think it's weird that I'm calling stable coins an application But I consider them to be one because it's like they're they're they they live with so much value to the ecosystem Now what I mean by sustainable is that they're not we want we need these applications to not be On either extreme during market cycles so for example there are certain apps that get like a lot of use For maybe a couple of months in a bull market, then they get basically zero use in a bear market That's the that's the extreme right the zero to a hundred is the spectrum some and and and during those kind of like couple months In a bull market an app will be at a hundred and they'll be flying they'll think they've got product market feet I think that everything's amazing and then they'll be at zero during the bear market Whereas something like a uni swap or an ENS or stable coins while they do benefit obviously they do better during bull markets It's not a zero or a hundred market fit And then they do better during bull markets. It's not a zero or a hundred thing for them It's more like you know maybe in bull markets they do 70 80 90 maybe not a hundred right because a hundred would mean that they kind of like have this massive spike all of a sudden And then kind of like go to drop drop down from there And then maybe they drop to 40 or 50 during a bear market so to speak But it's never zero or a hundred for them right it's always kind of like a nuanced in the middle No, they're still growing They still got traction And they're still gonna be there the next time the market heats up as well and they're still gonna be there in a really big Way, so I think those three at the top of my head But you know most of the stuff in this ecosystem is it does not fall into that category at all now because of that All of this extra capacity that we have coming online over the next 12 to 18 months whether it be the layer twos themselves Adding extra capacity or layer one upgrades like dank shard a proto dank sharding They go I think like this time next year or maybe a bit later than that within the next 12 to 18 months I'm gonna make the bold prediction that we're actually gonna have more Ethereum decentralized block space and I call it a theorem block space because if it's a true roll up a true layer two It's considered a theorem block space in my mind If we're gonna have so much of it coupled with proto dank sharding that I don't think we're gonna have enough demand to fill it All so the fees for end users at layer two are going to absolutely collapse like they're gonna be So cheap that people are gonna wonder why they ever they ever doubted a theorem scaling to begin with Now that actually presents a bit of a challenge the challenge it presents is okay. How do we build more sustainable applications? How do we fill this new block space that we have and I think there's a few different ways we can do it one is that layer twos are going to they're gonna What's what I'm looking for? They're gonna open up a bunch of new design space for applications So things that can't be done on layer one will be able to be done on layer two So that's that's a big thing. Actually, that's actually actually what probably the biggest thing that's gonna happen with that extra block space That's available in that not just a block space But the kind of like extra way the new ways to develop applications on layer two that you can't do on layer one Especially around the non EVM ecosystems like Stark net for example, right? That's the first thing second thing is they're gonna enable kind of like not just new applications, but new types of applications So what I mean by that is that there's been applications that have been tried on layer one a theorem before such as decentralized social Media that just don't work due to scalability on layer two. They they kind of like will work because they get more scalability there And then from there it just becomes okay. Do people actually want to use as applications, you know, here's all the scale We don't need to worry about scale anymore It's cheap to use or even free to use but do people actually want to use it? I think they will if it's good enough, right if it actually adds enough as I said social and monetary value to them It can add only one thing like people don't use Twitter I and you know a lot of other use Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and expect any money Terry value out of it Yes, there are people that use it like for example on Instagram You can be like an influencer or something and make money that way But the majority of people do not use it as a way to make money But right now in crypto the majority of people use it to make money and yes crypto is obviously heavily financialized But at the same time there are many more non-financial applications that we can build that that we can kind of like They're sorry that will be able to be built because of layer twos And I think the last thing is that we need to stop doing this kind of like game of do liquidity mining Ponzi five the app for a few months and let's you know Let's get a lot of growth really quickly and then have to pay for that Over the count over the kind of like the course of the next few years Because we basically borrowed from the future for that growth that trend it needs to reverse Or just kind of like completely stop or at least slow down for us to get more sustainable applications So those would be like the three major things that I'm kind of looking at But yeah, I think within the next 12 to 18 months We're gonna have more block space than we know what to do with and you could argue We already have that today in terms of optimism and armor trim have more capacity than we're using of just as examples there But but the thing is is that they're still expensive because layer one relatively expensive, right? Because layer one is still expensive for them. But once we have proto dang sharding in place and layer twos Costs for layer one and negligible then we're gonna have like sub sent transaction fees potentially on some of these layer twos Especially with their own upgrades like compression and things like that Well call that a compression. That's what I'm looking for that. You know, people aren't gonna know what to do with the extra block space So I'm super excited for that Actually, I think it's gonna be really cool to see it kind of flip from having too much demand on enough block space having too Much block space and not enough demand We're gonna have to see how that goes and it depends on marking conditions at the time as well Like if the markets like super bullish in another 12 to 18 months, then maybe we'll fill that capacity in the short term But I'm more about like the long-term sustainable Ecosystems, I don't want to say just short term ism. But I mean, I don't think we anyone can stop that from happening There's always going to be those boom and busts, but I hope that we can build more sustainable applications going forward Alright, uh, another thing that I tweeted out today was got to do with Mining so I said there will be an insane influx of GPUs hitting the secondary market after the merge is completed I think this may lead to a double whammy positive narrative narrative change from gamers specifically They may stop hating a theorem since it's now prove a stake and they'll also love the cheap GPUs. So basically GPUs right now are being used like a lot of them are being used to mine aetherium because of that There's there was a GPU shortage for a very long time and GPU prices skyrocketed I bought one when there was they were kind of like a really high in price I actually had to buy one because my one died. I bought a 3080 TI from Nvidia It cost me three and a half thousand Australian dollars that same graphics card today is $2,100 I think and this is before this influx comes from the the crypto from the aetherium miners once the merge is completed here So and game is hated crypto because of this like they absolutely hated it and then the second point is that they hate crypto or hate Ethereum and because it's proof of work And because it's like bad for the environment or they believe it's bad for the environment, right? So that's those are the two things that are gonna change the game is gonna have really cheap GPUs to pick up on the secondary market and they're also going to go into um, oh some of them at least will know that it's because Ethereum transition to proof of stake and is no longer bad for the environment. So I'm looking forward to that I really really am I think it's going to be a great narrative shift outside of crypto obviously Narratives within crypto are a different kind of like ball game good ball game, but outside of crypto I think it's gonna be a very very positive shift So looking forward to that and there's a bunch of great discussions in the replies as well here if you want to check them out Polyna brought up the fact that some of these GPUs can be used for ZK proving and I've discussed this before they can but I don't think there's gonna be enough demand to absorb most of these GPUs By the time the merge happens like the merge is happening in August or September guys Like they we're not even close to being able having a kind of like l21 to decentralize It's it's proving like it's a K proving right so it will happen eventually But I don't think there's gonna be anywhere near enough demand to soak up all the the GPUs that are gonna be hitting the market Due to kind of like mining I'm going by the wayside here So very much looking forward to kind of like seeing the I guess like the the the fallout from this All right, so our swell network put together a little tweet thread today And they started by saying liquid staking is the talk of the town lately and will become more popular after the e2 merge Existing solutions have paved the way for liquid staking and have proven to be robust But what's left to be desired, but what's left to be desired? Here's our staking 2.0 manifesto with nine reasons to use swell network for liquid eat staking now I've discussed swell I think a couple of times on the refill before disclosure I'm an investor and advisor to swell just want to get that out there. I don't know if I've said that on the refill before But yeah, just getting that out there, but the reason I bring them up is because I've talked a lot about Lido dominance recently and about how I believe one of the the core pillars of you know peeling people off lighter and reducing lido's dominance or at least Pausing it for the time being until withdraws are enabled and then we can work on reducing it is more competition We obviously have rocker pool and they have their own issues that they're working through because they have those minimums at the next They need to kind of like bring down and there are a bunch of other things going on there And I obviously promote rocker pool a bunch on here as well But there's also I've talked about steak wise before there is swell network and there's a bunch of others out there And there's all these liquid staking providers. They're going to work to take dominance away from light And that's what we want. So that's why I was like, yeah, okay I'd love to be an investor advisor and in swell because I want to kind of like support them I want to help them a major reason being to take away from from lido's market share And I'm trying to become a rocket pool kind of like ODA member I definitely want to get a kind of like a note up eventually as well kind of like with rocker pool to support them as much As I can and and steak wise as well. I mean I just mentioning them. I think that I'm able to support them Just just do that mind that kind of like front. I don't hold any steak wise tokens or anything like that But but yeah, so I'm trying to just basically take that dominance away or at least make it a healthier kind of like staking ecosystem I've talked about it a lot on the refuel before but but yeah definitely go give this thread from swell network a read You may want to stake with them when they're live instead of Instead of lido or rocker pool or whoever else it's up to you to decide who you want to go with I'm not going to tell you who to go with guys like I'm just gonna Put out the solutions. I'm gonna highlight the ones that I think are worthwhile to look into And then you can make decision for yourself, but I will say one thing though I know lido is very tempting right now to kind of like stake with because they have big liquidity pools And things like that even though the peg is off the liquidity balls pool is still big they make it very easy to kind of like stake with them But I would suggest staking with one of the others like this is this you know I think of this like I think about client Diversity it's not that lido is a bad service right there a good service like that I mean they wouldn't have so much a stake with them if they weren't a good service Just like it's not like prism is a bad client right but the thing is is that if you care about the health of the beacon Chain if you care about the health of the overall ethereum ecosystem Then I think as being a good beacon chain citizen or a good ethereum citizen It's your duty to make sure and to be aware of the fact that Staking with lido at this point in time is actually detrimental to the network just like using prism when they were the supermajority Was detrimental to client diversity on the beacon chain Same goes for using geth right like on the execution of the ethereum ecosystem Same goes for using geth right like on the execution layer side you should be using nethermind or base You or you know instead of geth not because geth is bad But but just because they have too much dominance on the execution layer side for client diversity And you should be thinking about the health of the beacon chain and things like that as well So definitely give this thread from small network a raid. I'll link it in the YouTube description Alright, so speaking of client diversity claim based cloud put together a thread here about how they're working on client diversity And this is basically an update so they talked about it on February 23rd This is an update coming about 3 March April May 3 in a little bit months later Which is which is cool to see you can read this thread and kind of like give a give a Gives a breakdown of what they've been working on I've highlighted how coinbase was able to reduce their prison usage substantially After the client diversity push was was done Which is really cool to see but we actually have a starts right from kind of like one base themselves here Where they say coinbase retail now has 65% of its validators on non prism clients So they have 30 only 35 percent prism clients. That's awesome and most of their clients are on lighthouse and prism right now I think they're doing even more work in the background in order to Support further client diversity so coinbase is being a good beacon chain citizen They were at like 90 95 percent prison usage Then there was that push and then they understood the risks of running a majority a supermajority client they understood that they need to kind of reduce that in order to help the ecosystem and help the beacon chain and And maintain kind of like the security here and the health of the beacon chain and they did it which is really really cool to See so I mean I big kudos to coinbase here for doing this and definitely check out this thread I'll link it in the YouTube description for you to do so All right last couple of things here So I put out another tweet today where I said the shift in narrative over the last few months from a theorem whenever transition to Proof of stake to people arguing that proof of stake is just like the existing banking system is hilarious The haters will always move the goal process. This is typically a sign that they have no real arguments So this is quite funny, right? people always Say this in the non kind of like if you're a Bitcoin maximalist camp They always try to kind of like say that proof of stake is just like the existing banking system Or it's rich get richer or its plutocracy or there's on-chain governance Sometimes some people say that I know it's like no it doesn't have on-chain governance But before that before that you know that's happened in the last few months before that There was this major narrative that a theorem would never transition to prove of stake because it kept getting quote unquote delayed Or I took forever and to be fair it did but the thing is is that They can't say this anymore like the the smarter ones and some of these people aren't actually dumb They're just kind of like blinded by bias But now the smarter ones have realized that okay the ethereum merge is actually happening If the room is actually going to finally transition to prove of stake so what else can we say to kind of like? Discredit this and one of the narratives as I pointed out is them Kind of like comparing it to the existing banking system saying it's plutocratic saying the rich get richer saying all these other kind of like shitty narratives and as I said if People are always moving the goalpost to try and kind of like highlight weaknesses in something Then it's typically a sign that they have no real arguments that they can put forward no real debates No real anything and that just is the kind of like the short Short sign to me and they got no idea what they're talking about and they're just speaking from like a biased position here on To be fair it happens with everything not just proof of stake But yeah I just want to like one of the hide that for you guys as you're waiting through public opinion on things like it's just it's Always funny whenever I see these sorts of things because you can obviously tell they haven't done their research They're just speaking from position of bias and just speaking purely out of kind of like hate for something right which which doesn't lend Theirself to very good arguments at all All right last up here.

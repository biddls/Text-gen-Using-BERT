 Hello everyone, welcome to another episode of the daily grey refuel where I cap the latest news in the ethereum ecosystem I'm your host the end the nss on it as the 5th of september 2022. All right everyone. Let's get into it so hell press here shared a screenshot from the uh, kind of like, um, Ethereum discord here that shows that mainnet shadow fork 12 went perfectly there were zero issues found so this was basically a Perfect shadow fork or a perfect merge. You can actually see exactly what was said here by Parathosh who said mainnet shadow fork 12 merged one hour ago. This is on the 31st of august We used versions advertised in the ethereum foundation blog post so far. We found zero issues There are no missed proposals Assestation rate didn't change pre to post merge and the network seems really stable great job to all the client teams This is a massive milestone as you guys probably know as you've been following along with these shadow forks and with the testnet forks So I guess like the testnet Merge transitions, you'll know that none of them have been 100 perfect, right? There are configuration issues here There were test station issues here the validators being offline here and there and you know Some clients would just wouldn't produce blocks or produce invalid blocks and things like that But apparently with mainnet shadow fork 12 that is not an issue at all It just went completely perfectly which is crazy to me because I mean when you really think about it It requires all the clients to work together to talk to each other for there to be no issues during the merge transition And we haven't seen that before And you know, even I said that I expect there to be at least kind of like some issues with some clients With the mainnet merge transition just because there's so many kind of moving parts to it And especially when it comes to configuration issues, especially for people who may not have configured correctly Because they haven't done it with the testnets and they haven't done it on the shadow forks or anything like that i'm expecting some kind of turbulence with it with the mainnet merge fork in terms of some of the validators, but In terms of like it going smoothly. I expect it to go smoothly We're probably going to see a participation drop off Um of a few percent or even potentially more than that I'm, not, you know 100 sure how much it's going to be obviously, I don't know But I think that the fact that the shadow fork has gone Perfectly means that there wouldn't be an issue with kind of the clients or anything like that It'd more be an issue with the configurations or with people's, you know their own setups, right? If they're a solo stake or maybe they've set up something wrong, maybe they haven't actually set up their execution client, right? Maybe they haven't set up their jwt token correctly and all that sort of stuff there Which is easily rectified and quickly rectified Rectified once the merge transition happens and their validators stop kind of attesting and they start losing rewards Um, and you know on that note as well I actually got all of mine merged ready the other day and it's actually pretty easy pretty straightforward and i'm doing it all manually I'm not using Dap node or anything like i'm doing mine totally Manually on my own setup So but a lot of solo stakers I know are using Dap node which makes it super easy to do and also super easy to Change clients, so I don't expect there to be any major issues there and we are so close now to the merge guys I mean what it's like 10 days like if you go to bordell.wtf here It says that the merge is expected around september 15th at 2 p.m. Oh, sorry 2 a.m. UTC Uh, and then yeah, I mean even the other website that I was showing you guys last week 797.io Still says september 14th. It's set at I guess like 5 p.m. UTC But because the hash rate's been going up and down it's it's kind of hard to get an exact measure But it's going to happen on september 14th or 15th, basically So around 10 days from now Which is just insanely close like I actually took a little bit of a break over the last few days Um, as you guys know, I didn't I missed a couple of refuels last week So i've just been taking a break because I I think that leading up to the merge and around the merge It's going to be a lot of insanity Um, not not particularly with prize but just with like a lot of information out there a lot of celebrations a lot of things happening And you know i'm kind of like thinking that this merge call because there's that merge call that we're doing Mainnet merge call that we're doing myself, um bankless and eastaker is going to end up happening at like 4 a.m 4 a.m. My time or something like that, right? Like it's just going to happen that way right now I don't think it's scheduled for that I think it's scheduled for around 1 p.m Depending on which scheduler you look at but as I said, it's hard to kind of know exactly when that's going to happen But we're close we're very close and it's just amazing that this mainnet shadow fork 12 was a perfect run There wasn't any issues with it now. I haven't checked back in Since this tweet, I don't know if there was other there was any issues that sprung up later on But at the time of the merge transition, uh, there there wasn't kind of like any um any issues with it And uh, it seems like everything went perfectly But if you want to keep uh up to date with the merge time You can go to these two websites bordell.wtf or 797.io slash the merge I'll link them both in the youtube description for you to check out as well So speaking of the merge, uh, there's another update here on the merge nft So you can see here from the stateful works account Another week brings us closer to the merge and the new home of the heart exhibition go live alongside jpeg Sophia garcia, uh, we can't wait to share with you all 14 Share it with you all 14 artists contributing work proceeds to benefit the protocol guild core devs that made the merge possible And you can see here that the the artists are listed on the right hand side and the art exhibition benefit Uh, you know all the proceeds from that are going to the protocol guild here I just wanted to remind you guys that this is still happening. This is still coming Uh, and these are the merge nfts to get your hand on if you want to be part of history here I think I don't I think that these are the main nfts and I think there will be other ones out there I've seen some floating around that are fan made but in terms of kind of like, um, I'm minting something or minting an nft. That's part of the main nft set I think this is it and this is the uh, the funds are going to go towards core dev here as well, which is which is very awesome Uh, and last thing about the merge is I will be doing a twitter spaces with super fizz and itamar from argent here In less than 24 hours from when this video goes live. So this is happening. Tuesday 6th of september 2 p.m UTC i'm very much looking forward to it. We're going to be talking all things the merge and you know I can't wait to talk alongside super fears and and itamar here two people that have been around In the ethereum ecosystem for a very long time here. I think I have a lot to say especially super fears I mean I talk about him a lot on the refuel but that guy is awesome when it comes to everything The beacon chain everything ethereum staking so I can't wait to do these twitter spaces in less than 24 hours I'll leave a link to that in the youtube description below for you All right, so mario have i'll hear from the ethereum foundation announced or at least shared a blog post announcing the ethereum protocol fellowship This is the fast track to becoming an ethereum core dev and it's now open It's a fellowship program for anyone who's interested in diving deeply into the core protocol resources And you can kind of like check out this blog post here to see all the details now I believe they've done one or two of these in the past the ethereum foundation. I remember covering it on the refuel And you can see here the past cohorts that they've kind of uh worked to Yeah, they've hosted two successful cohorts and past cohort members have gone on to work on alternative method of documenting and specifying ethereum protocol Researched how we can modify or remove the self-destruct opcode helped build zk sync built out new peer-to-peer networks for the portal network, which has got to do with Statelessness, uh wrote their own implementation of the evm and 10 cohort alumni now work full-time on core protocol development And five others work in adjacent areas of the industry So if that interests you if you want to be involved with things like this and you want to be able to work on Some of the most interesting and bleeding edge stuff within ethereum then this is the program for you You should definitely go check it out. You should definitely go apply if it if if it's something that you're interested in I mean honestly from I like my point of view I i'm not a developer or researcher or anything like that But if I was this is the thing i'd be going for I don't really consider there to be anything else as interesting as working on The ethereum core protocol maybe the layer twos because they're closely related I think to to um core protocol work and they can kind of work alongside the core protocol But for me personally app level stuff like the I don't know it just doesn't interest me the same way protocol level stuff does Even though i've i've been a big advocate for the app layer and i'm obviously a big advocate for us having better app layered Products being launched because of the fact that there's no point building all the core protocol stuff if the app layer is lacking I just personally am much more interested in the core protocol stuff, but i'm interested in it as as an educator, right? Like I haven't done any research. I haven't published any research. I haven't done any uh Kind of a core development itself. I haven't done really any development as i'm not a developer But I do a lot of education around it and that that's just personally what I find, uh most interesting But there are a lot of people out there who are the complete opposite of me. They don't really you know care for For educating but they definitely want to get into the weeds propose new research or do research Help with core development and be part of the ethereum history that way and that just speaks to how many different ways and how many different Opportunities you have to be involved with ethereum Because you don't have to just settle for one small corner You can do everything or you can just do you know something that really uh, it really resonates with you Like I consider myself a generalist as an educator But you can just dive headfirst into ethereum core protocol development and spend all your time on that or core protocol research And not really have to pay attention to anything else right like you don't as a core protocol researcher and developer You don't have to concern yourself too much with the app layer like what you're building should just allow the app layer to proliferate But you yourself don't have to get into the weeds of every single project right you just work on what you work on And that's it so if this if that sounds like something you love doing or want to do You should definitely go check out this fellowship i'll link it in the youtube description below for you to do so and you can go get all the details there So the ethereum foundation blog has had a major overhaul and is now available in 16 languages i've spoken about my view on the ethereum, I guess like language support generally across the ecosystem i've Often talked about how I think that it's kind of weird that we still don't have a lot of multiple language support on the app layer But the ethereum.org website has a lot of different languages supported there and now the ethereum foundation blog has been translated into 16 different Languages and i'm sure there's more ongoing there isn't all the blog posts from the ethereum foundation blog translated I think it's a kind of like an ongoing effort here, but this is great at the end of the day I've said it before but i'm not going to go into the next section At the end of the day i've said it before and i'll say it again We way over index on english in the ethereum community even though we're supposed to be a global distributed decentralized community We over index on english just because that's just the way it is right. English is a very dominant language It has incredible network effects and there definitely is a vibe between I guess west and east as there traditionally is just generally and it's funny because I was looking at uh, Kind of uh, I guess like the alt l1 space the other day and I was thinking to myself What's the most successful alt l1 after all the dust has settled what has actually had staying power and funny enough? It's bsc right binance smart chain. I think this is for two major reasons The first reason is obviously binance support like a world's biggest crypto exchange putting all their weight behind The bsc allowing people to bridge in and out very easily for you know very cost effectively and not caring about decentralization at all and just Basically having like a centralized on-chain casino essentially for people to play with right? The second thing is that a lot of the people using bsc are actually not from the west They're not english-speaking. They're more so from the east because binance has always had a very big presence in asia I mean it was born out of asia. Cz himself is from from asia So that is a huge kind of driver of their traffic there and I think the ethereum community has I mean intentionally or not ignored that whole cohort there because we don't have a lot of language support at the end of the day Yeah, you can do like auto translations and stuff like that But with language comes the culture too and I think in the ethereum community we have we are very westernized and you know very us and and and europe centric whereas bsc But you know binance and I think there was a couple of other chains out there, you know, I tried to Appeal to the asian market. I remember the there was neo in 2017 and 2018 called the the um The chinese ethereum that never caught on but it's funny because bsc seemed to seem to catch on as like the asian ethereum So to speak because bsc really is just an evm chain at the end of the day But it is appealed to a completely different cohort and also a different Cohort in terms of uh people being able to afford to use the chain, right? So in saying all of that we definitely need to keep pushing on more language support not just for obviously asian speak The different languages in asia, but also in the middle east, you know in eastern europe as well Like all these places that we've traditionally not appealed to and not actually been in we need to do that because ethereum can't call itself A global network if we're just appealing to english speakers like yes, okay English is spoken by billions of people but it does it regardless like we're still leaving billions of people Uh excluded from it because they don't speak english and they have no plans to to learn how to speak english And they shouldn't be expected to learn how to speak a completely different language just to be able to use the things that we're building So I think that the ethereum foundation has done an amazing job on both the ethereum.org Site for language support and also on on the blog now and I just wanted to give them a big kudos for doing that Because I think it's extremely important. I wish more of the app layer, uh kind of projects did this on their front ends, but Yeah, I mean we can't force them to do it, right? They have to do it on through their own accord But it all happened probably slowly over time. Some of them do have it but I I think i'm surprised it hasn't happened more I think that's just maybe because a lot of them don't realize how much of their user base they're living on the table by not supporting The uh, the non-english speaking countries and maybe they just haven't really thought of it at the end of the day So so yeah, but anyway kudos to the ethereum foundation for pushing along here All right. So sam calda mason here announced something called checkpoints with a z Over the weekend. So this is an ethereum beacon chain checkpoint sync provider So what the features that come with this is that it reduces the operational burden of providing a full checkpoint sync endpoint Web ui for users to cross reference against and a light mode for homestakers So what can you use this for? Well because the mainnet merges quickly approaching and the window to get your beacon node synced in time Is closing this checkpoint sync lets your node download Download a finalized checkpoint that is close to the head of the chain and then once complete you verify that the sync went as expected So in reality, it's hard to find an endpoint for you to use the initial download and just as hard to find somewhere to verify your sync Checkpoints aims to help with both of these problems and it has two modes of operation Light mode and and full mode and you can read the rest of the details in this thread here but yeah I mean if you are a solo staker and you need to Or if you want to become a solo staker before the merge comes around and you want to sync the beacon You know your beacon node you can I guess like sync from scratch which is Very I guess intensive and very time consuming or you sync from one of these checkpoints and I mean in the future Or at least even even these days like exclusively there's you'd be seeking from a checkpoint because there's something called weak subjectivity where The chain will become too heavy It'll take too long to sync that you need to be able to you that you will be using these checkpoints always to sync but the reason why you can Have guarantees around these checkpoints is because you can actually check and you can see here you can actually check the State route and the block route to make sure that you're on the right chain and the reason it's called weak subjectivity Is because it's still subjective where you're getting the head of the chain from you're choosing it from either checkpoints or some other provider But it is not a strong Subjective because sorry it's not strong subjectivity because of the fact that you can actually verify yourself with the state route and the block route here and have Pretty good guarantees that you're on the the right chain right you're on the You're out there at the right head of the chain. So yeah, I'm this is really cool I think this is just in time obviously for the merge here So if that is you if you are someone that is merging or so I should say syncing from From scratch for the merge as a solo staker Or if you're changing clients and you accidentally corrupted your database or or you're kind of like You deleted your database someone like that Then this is something you should definitely check out and i'll link it in the youtube description below For you to do so and just on that note as well Just a friendly reminder. I kind of mentioned before but I want to remind you again if you are a solo staker If you're running any kind of staking software Make sure like this is the most important thing going into the merge that you essentially run a local execution layer client It can be geth. It can be nethermine. It can be Basu Maybe eragon but eragon's that's the kind of like similar to get if you're going for client diversity you would go for nethermind or basu And also you need to get your jwt token generated and link all that up now The easiest way to do this is to go to the merge readiness checklist You can google that and it walks you through it all and then there's the optional extras like mev boost and stuff like that Which you can do as well But just make sure that you have all of that synced and ready to go for the merge because if you don't If you're not running your own execution layer client You will not be able to go through the merge transition from and from my understanding your validator will just simply go Look offline to the protocol and you'll start inactivity leaking out After not, you know after a few kind of like missed asset attestations there There's another reminder for people out there that are running these things running validators for solo stakers If you are staking with a third-party provider Like if you just bought ste or if you just bought our eith Then you don't have to worry about that the people running the nodes will have to worry about that I mean you can have relative certainty that it's all fine on their end But you would probably want to I don't know double check for yourself and maybe asking the discord and the rocker pool discord Uh, if everything's up to date and I expect it to be fine even in the lighter discord But I expect all of it to be fine And as I said if it's not they're going to quickly course correct because if they don't they're leaking value and it's not good For anyone. So yeah, but anyway you go you can go check this out. I'll link it in the youtube description below All right, so let's get started All right, so ens announced over the weekend that in collaboration with cloudflare They've set up another alternative gateway on eith.domains meaning you can add either dot domains or dot limo To your ens name to reach it via the web and they're continuing to work on recovering access to eith.link Now for those of you who don't know eith.link access is currently in limbo because the name is earned by owned by virgil griffith Who as I guess like ens dao said is currently unavailable which is putting it lightly he is in prison, right? He is in prison right now, right? He was prosecuted for his Involvement in going to north korea and and when breaking us sanctions So obviously as he owns eith.link is in prison. He can't access that so right now It's it's unable to to to be accessed and unable to be obtained to renew the uh, the the name eith.link here So as an alternative you can use Dot domains or dot limo for your ens name to reach it via the web. Just wanted to give a shout out there For that in case you were confused as to why eith.link isn't working and why it's offline. This is kind of I guess a Really shitty situation here. I wonder how this is going to go like will virgil be able to give instructions to someone he trusts To get that domain Kind of transfer. Oh, sorry that that that no that domain name and transfer ownership or renewal or anything like that I'm, not sure we'll have to see how that goes. But that was august 26th when that was announced there So maybe something has been rectified since then, but I haven't seen it but there are still these alternatives that you can use regardless And you can see them on on the screen here. And it's dot domains and dot limo for you there All right, so an announcement out of ingonyama today They've introduced something called cloud dash zk which is a toolkit for developing zero knowledge proof acceleration in the cloud Tldr today we are open source a new way to accelerate zk using fpga in aws cloud easy accessible cheap Read on or check out the blog post thread So there's a thread here announcing exactly what this is for a refresher for you guys ingonyama is building zero knowledge asics And I am an investor in them just want to disclose that there But this is the kind of bleeding edge stuff that we want to be seeing in the zk space That is on the hardware side of things. Uh, it is a piece of software but to power the hardware That will be able to generate these zk Zkps or zero knowledge proofs because without I guess speedy generation zero knowledge roll-ups are quite limited because the the cost From my understanding the biggest cost of a zero knowledge roll-up is the time and the resources to generate the zero knowledge proof now if we can get them down as much as possible then we kind of get get for get um, what's the word i'm looking for get closer to realizing that Reality of uh, the holy grail of scaling solutions for ethereum which is full zk roll-ups with cheap zkp Proving here so you can read this blog post for exactly what this is. This is more geared towards I think developers and more technical people of course, but it's great to see that there are A lot of things happening in the zk acceleration space here on the zkp proving space because as I said It is definitely very very needed and ingonyama is completely focused on this This is like their whole jam and i'm glad that there is a company that does this I was actually extremely excited to back them when I When I was given the opportunity because i've been talking about It for a while on the refill before I even knew about them about this this hardware that we would need and also the software To power that hardware and I think it's going to be one of the most important companies Going forward as we get into, you know get further down the layer 2 scaling roadmap that ethereum he's going down right now All right. So finally here speaking of layer 2's stark net alpha version 0.10.0 has been released to girly so this version is going to be released to So this version is another step towards scaling ethereum without compromising on security and decentralization as stark west says here and you can read the blog post Uh about sorry, you can read the blog post i'll link in the youtube description But the main features are that there are account abstraction improvements in the spirit of eip4337 validate execute separation transaction uniqueness is now ensured in the protocol the fever mechanism has been extended to include l1 to l2 messages And declare transactions and there's also a few kyro syntax changes. So as I said You can read the blog post for a further breakdown here with links to even even more breakdowns on all of this Uh, but great to see stark net alpha a new version of stock net alpha rolled out to girly here Not on mainnet, of course, uh, but on on a test net i'm sure this will be pushed pushed to mainnet sooner rather than later And I actually really like this artwork here. This is really cool It's got like uh stairs on the left mountains on the right and then like a galaxy Uh, sorry mountains in the middle and then a galaxy on the right Really speaks to I guess stark waves brand branding around voyaging out into the unknown as a as a zero knowledge or a stark Scaling infrastructure here. So very cool image there But yeah I think that's going to be it for the updates now i've left a bit of time here at the end today because I have Something that I want to discuss particularly leading up to the merge, which I said before is happening in around 10-ish days, right? I think what's on everyone's mind right now is what the markets are going to do and i've spoken about this before and you guys Know that I don't think the merge is priced in but as I said on my podcast with how press and as how said himself There are different levels of priced in right depending on your time frame My time frame is very very long term whenever I say I don't think something is priced in i'm talking many many years I'm not talking like 6-12 months. I'm talking 5 10 15 20 years. That's my time horizon So I think people miss that whenever I say it and it's fair to miss that. I mean, it's not something obvious But I want to talk short term for a second not something that I normally do but I want to talk about it because I think It's important. I'm seeing a lot of people make comments about it. So I think it's important for me to give my two cents here It's probably going to be a volatile time right even in a bear market There are players out there who are trying to take advantage of information asymmetries Trying to play pvp matches with other traders out there and basically also positioning themselves for any possible forks that are happening There's a popular trade right now where you long spot which basically means you buy ETH like actual ETH You withdraw it to your wallet or something or put have it on exchange so that you can have exposure in case there is a proof-of-work ethereum fork and you get that airdrop, but then you short the futures or Contracts, sorry, you're you you you short futures for ETH so that you're basically in a neutral position So essentially doesn't matter what way the ETH price moves. You're not losing money on that, right? That's that's kind of like the strategy because obviously if you are only trying to capture the forked coins Then you don't want to open yourself up to losing money on longing ETH just in case ETH went down Because that would just negate the profit you can make from the coin So that's a very popular trade right now and you may have seen some charts out there of open interest which measures measures this leverage In the system for ETH going up and up and up and I think that's a big reason because of it now What does this mean for the price post merge? I think that what we're gonna see is We're gonna see volatility But I think because we're in a bear market It's gonna be way less volatile than it otherwise would have you could imagine the merge happening in like the peak bull market Say say the merge was happening in April 2021 just before we peaked in May 2021 It would have been extremely volatile, right? Like we were probably still gonna peak But it would have been even more volatile because of the fact that we had this massive catalyst of the merge Basically right there we had this issue introduction We had all the positive stuff coming with it, but we had also run up a lot I mean people often forget that we went from about $90 in March 2020 to $4,400 in May 2021 In like 14 months we went up over 40x on one of the largest market caps in crypto I mean ETH was number two, right? So when you think about it like that, even if the merge was happening around then I think we still would have topped out Maybe we would have gone higher than $4,400, but we still would have topped out. It would have been extremely violent It would have probably been similar to the Bitcoin Bitcoin cash thing that happened in late 2017 Where there was a massive catalyst around that, there was tons of volatility, it was just crazy But given it's happening in a bear market and given the price has really just been going sideways For weeks now, I mean, yeah, we came off the bottom, but we haven't really done anything special We went to $2k, we came back down, kind of gone sideways now It's not really anything special There's not really any new entrants in, I mean NFT volumes is one of the things that I look at the most They've basically collapsed from their highs a lot The on-chain activity is still very much down Layer 2s are growing, but I feel like that's just Layer 1 users migrating to Layer 2s at this point Not really net new users yet Which means, yeah, we're basically in the depths I feel like we're in 2019 personally So there will be volatility, but I don't expect it to be anything as violent as it would have been And if you're trading around this, I mean, that's your prerogative, but I don't know I feel like trading around this is extremely risky, especially on leverage So for me personally, you guys know I'm just stacking ETH long spot as a normal year And I don't plan to trade around, I don't plan to sell any ETH or anything like that I don't care about any forked coins, like it doesn't really bother me if I get them or not Honestly, I probably won't because most of my ETH is in staking So I don't think I'm going to get any if my ETH is in staking Which again, as I said, I don't really care about that But if you want to position yourselves for that, you can But as I've mentioned before, there are risks associated with that too Depending on what fork you use, there could be no replay protection And you want to be aware of that So I think just leading up to the merge, we're very close now in the next 10 days Things are going to get a bit noisy, I think Not as noisy as they would have been in a bull market, thankfully Still a bit noisy So just keep your wits about you Just try and stay level-headed, try and stay grounded If the ETH price starts going up a lot because of the hype I mean, I could see us going above 2K just because of the hype, right? It's not that far from here Just some people trying to play the trade My advice is always the same Like, I don't think that leverage is healthy, right? And I think that getting caught up in that sort of stuff is a one-way ticket to rec town But at the same time, I don't try to give financial advice on the refuel I don't try to talk short-term markets I'm always a long-term guy I know most of you are as well But I just want to put that warning out there because we are just 10 days away Like, it's crazy I'm still kind of a disbelief that we're just 10 days away from this event And things are relatively quiet And as I said, I think that's just solely because it's a bear market And people are trying to fade it They're trying to be like, oh, you know, the merge, you've heard about it forever Okay, cool, let's just get it over with And because the price isn't doing anything, people aren't really too excited about it But us hardcore Ethereum who've been waiting for this for a long time Or maybe you're a newer Ethereum and it's just something that excites you I mean, we're all super pumped for it We're just 10 days out, it's happening, so the market stuff is pretty much irrelevant Like, I don't even care what the ETH price does I'm just so happy that Ethereum is going to be a full proof-of-stake network in just 10 days I mean, I've been waiting for this since the first day I heard about Ethereum The first thing, one of the first things I read about Ethereum Was that it was going to transition to proof-of-stake And that was one of the first things that got me excited about it I've been waiting for this for over five years now So for me, it's a big deal I think for a lot of other people, it's even bigger deal that have been in it longer And yeah, I just can't wait for it to happen But just some words of caution there But I think on that note, I'm going to end it there for today So thank you everyone for listening and watching Be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't yet Give the video a thumbs up, subscribe to the newsletter Join the Discord channel And I'll catch you all tomorrow Thanks everyone

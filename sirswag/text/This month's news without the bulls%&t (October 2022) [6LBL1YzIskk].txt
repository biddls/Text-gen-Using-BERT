We don't usually cover weather events because there generally isn't much insight we can give to a combination of warm ocean water and moist air combining to make angry wind but we'll make an exception if shit gets really big From late September to early October the state of Florida, parts of North Carolina and Cuba were hit with a strong category for hurricane affectionately called Hurricanian On its visit to Cuba Ian caused mass flooding and power outages as well as damaging over 60,000 homes and taking the lives of three people The outages were followed by unrest within the capital of Havana and represented some of the largest seen within the country since the wave of anti-government protests from July last year Hurricanian has brought even more hardship to the people of Cuba who have contended with a mixed command economy crippling US sanctions and an inflation rate that just keeps getting higher On a completely unrelated note this month marks the 60th anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis The hurricane would then make its way over to Florida before stopping in North Carolina collectively displacing 40,000 people and taking the lives of another 100 Ian now takes the record as the deadliest hurricane to hit Florida since 1935 and makes WatchMojo's top 10 list as the 7th most expensive storm in US history costing over $67 billion in damage This would be nearly enough to run the entire US military for the whole month of October Climate change has not been attributed to the formation of Hurricanian however, a collaboration of scientists would estimate that human-induced climate change had increased rain rates by over 10% during the storm Some nations are about as fucked as you can get and one of the most unlucky countries in this sense is the Caribbean nation of Haiti One of the poorest nations in the world Haiti has suffered some of the worst RNG imaginable which has only been compounded by complete government mismanagement for at least the past decade In 2010, the country suffered a magnitude 7 earthquake killing over 200,000 people which was then followed by Hurricane Thomas and a massive cholera outbreak that very same year 6 years later, Hurricane Matthew would cause billions more in damages and in 2018, the government would announce it would be effectively cutting all fuel subsidies within the country which would go on to cause a massive economic and humanitarian crisis by the following year By 2020, Haiti was then fucking nae nae'd by COVID-19 and by 2021, the nation's president, Jovenel Moise was assassinated by a group of mostly Colombian mercenaries funded by a Florida-based investment firm and recruited by a security company based in Miami We absolutely fucking swear we're not making this up Stop! He's already dead! Another earthquake and cholera outbreak later and arguably Haiti's biggest problem is currently its powerful gangs who have become extremely bold and increasingly more violent In fact, in recent months one of the country's most powerful gangs had surrounded a key fuel terminal in the nation's capital preventing the distribution of around 10 million gallons of diesel and gasoline The blockade has sparked a call from the nation's prime minister Ariel Henry, for international support to quell the gang activity and attempt to restore supply lines to the already crippled nation The call for aid has seemingly been answered by the United States and Mexico who have proposed a multinational security force be deployed within Haiti in an attempt to break gang activity and allow critical supplies to be distributed across the nation The proposal has not been without criticism however as a Chinese representative questioned whether foreign force would be welcomed by the Haitian people a sentiment which was echoed by a Russian representative who stated that many opposition groups within Haiti have not welcomed foreign intervention Protests against foreign intervention were held in the nation's capital of Port-au-Prince following the announcement, with demonstrators arguing that UN peacekeepers had previously been accused of sexual assault and had sparked a cholera epidemic that killed nearly 10,000 people Others within the nation have argued that foreign governments have no place in interfering with the domestic affairs of Haiti and that the government had no legitimacy to ask for military assistance in the first place Haiti has struggled to control gang activity with less than 13,000 police officers in a country of over 11 million people and even if this foreign intervention goes flawlessly the nation likely won't be in a good position for decades to come Just like we previously mentioned, Haiti is pretty fucked In our next story, we are going to Brazil where by the time you're watching this voting for the nation's presidential election has just been closed The race is primarily between two heavyweights in Brazilian politics coming down to the current president, Jair Bolsonaro and former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva affectionately called Lula among his supporters Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain, became president in 2018 riding on popular issues such as corruption, crime and the economy which scored him the nation's top job Mr. Bolsonaro has become particularly popular among farmers, gun owners and evangelical Christians and received praise for his modest economic reforms throughout his presidency However, we expect most people watching will likely know Bolsonaro for his numerous scandals since taking office Under his leadership, the nation had one of the worst responses to the COVID-19 pandemic seeing 687,000 deaths within the country In December 2020, the president would also suggest that COVID vaccines could have the capacity to turn people into crocodiles a fun fact that we really wish we could say we made up In terms of crime and corruption, his track record has also been spotty at best The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project comprised of a global network of investigative journalists actually awarded Bolsonaro Person of the Year for quote, his role in promoting organized crime and corruption detractors of the president also point toward his very underwhelming environmental record as environmental groups have reported that his administration has seen the highest rates of Amazon rainforest deforestation in the nation's history The Amazon is an estimated 17% smaller since Bolsonaro took office and when considering its environmental significance for the entire world many see this as a truly alarming statistic We now move on to Lula, a former union leader who held office in Brazil from 2003 to 2010 His two terms of presidency were characterized by growth in the Brazilian economy and his efforts to funnel profits from newly discovered commodities into social programs In 2017, Lula was convicted on money laundering and corruption and was subsequently sentenced to 9 and a half years in prison After 580 days in jail, the nation's Supreme Court ruled that incarcerations with pending appeals were unlawful and Lula was released as a result It was later ruled that the justice presiding over his case didn't have jurisdiction to do so and didn't possess enough evidence to convict Although the scandal tainted his reputation, Lula still left office with an 80% approval rating President Bolsonaro's strategy during his campaign has been to paint Lula as a radical socialist and he himself as a savior of the nation Lula on the other hand has touted Bolsonaro as a threat to democracy and has leaned into a strategy of trying to persuade citizens that they were better off when he was in power In the first round of voting, the polls were much closer than was initially expected with Jair Bolsonaro scooping up 43% of the vote while Lula took home a respectable 48% Due to our lengthy editing process, we can't actually announce who's going to win this year's election However, Mr. Bolsonaro has implied that he is unlikely to accept the result of the election should he come out behind In any case, viewers should hit the bell icon for when we inevitably cover the storming of Brazil's government building sometime next month On 22 October, Italy swore in its first female Prime Minister, 45-year-old Giorgia Miloni, of the Brothers of Italy party The Brothers of Italy are controversial in their own right as although Miloni describes it as a mainstream conservative party observers have characterized the party as having a right-wing populist appeal with a little bit of fascism to make things extra spicy The Brothers of Italy weren't born out of the embers of Benito Mussolini's National Fascist Party However, it did stem from the party which formed another party which then became the Brothers of Italy Kind of like how your teacher photocopied a worksheet that was first printed in 2006 In any case, some academics have characterized the party as a subset of the far-right that doesn't oppose democracy while others describe the party as outright neo-fascist or at the very least, having members that are linked to neo-fascism Whatever the case, Giorgia Miloni is Italy's most right-wing leader since Mussolini and that tends to make headlines With this in mind, the Brothers of Italy don't get to sit at the head of the table alone as they are also part of a coalition of other conservative parties including the center-right Forza Italia and the populist Liga Giorgia Miloni herself has been a vocal opponent of gay marriage and abortion and has become known for her Euro-skepticism and a hard-line zero-tolerance policy for illegal immigration The Brothers of Italy are generally in favor of nativism policies including the citizens of Italy above the interests of the rest of the European Union Many citizens within Italy have become disillusioned with its political landscape in recent months coming straight from a government crisis in the middle of July which saw the resignation of Prime Minister, Mario Draghi following months of tension surrounding economic policy Italy's general election in late September saw voter turnout fall to a record low of just under 64% with the Brothers of Italy taking the top spot with 26% of the vote According to a politics professor at Romsapienza University Giorgia Miloni scored the top spot owing to a combination of her ideological views while also being pragmatic in her approach to leadership Although she opposes the European Union she'd be crazy to turn down the nearly 200 billion euros of the EU's Covid recovery plan Miloni's strength is being able to remain ambiguous and if compromising with the EU doesn't work she can always fall back to populism if all else fails At a time when political faith within Italy is at a low point many within the nation see Giorgia Miloni as a young, capable and determined politician When a majority within the country have become so disillusioned with politics it's unsurprising that the nation would find a sense of solace with such a leader whether for better or for worse On the 14th of October, UK tabloid newspaper The Daily Star started a live stream of an iceberg lettuce in a blonde wig to see if the vegetable would outlast recently elected Prime Minister, Lestrass Seven days later, and after just 45 days in office Mistrass would resign from her position, ceding defeat to the gently wilting lettuce It was time for her to leave Lestrass's resignation makes her the shortest serving Prime Minister in UK history breaking the near 200 year old record set by George Canning who died in office after just 119 days Her short but chaotic premiership was marked by the death of Queen Elizabeth shaken investor confidence in UK markets an inflation rate as high as 10% and an exchange rate which saw the pound nearly come to parity with the US dollar Although some speculated that funny hair man might come back to reclaim his podium the position was instead filled with Rishi Sunak another member of the Conservative Party who was narrowly beaten by Truss only two months prior Sunak would pay tribute to his predecessor before stating mistakes were made Mr. Sunak, a former hedge fund manager, is the nation's first Asian Prime Minister born to Indian parents who migrated from East Africa in the 1960s Sunak himself is also one of the wealthiest people in the United Kingdom with his wife being the daughter of tech billionaire Narayana Murthy the sixth richest man in India The new Prime Minister is most importantly a confirmed gamer previously stating that he's a seasoned Mario Kart and Street Fighter player Although Prime Minister Sunak now holds the highest office in the country he recently stated that his dream job was either a Jedi Knight or an X-Wing Starfighter pilot In terms of actual policy Mr. Sunak has voiced support in lowering the bottom tax rate from 20% down to 16% but has stated that in order to fund these cuts through growth it would likely take several years He was also a proponent of increasing corporate tax from 19 to 25% and his previous policies have been characterized by reducing government spending Sunak is also a supporter of Brexit and a push toward net-zero emissions by 2050 However, environmental watchdogs have criticized his voting history in terms of climate change mitigation Other leaders around the world were quick to congratulate Mr. Sunak for his big promotion with Boris Johnson and Joe Biden commending him on his new position while former President of Russia Dmitry Medvedev would congratulate the lettuce Unlike his predecessor, it's hoped that Rishi Sunak can stay in his position long enough for a more favorable legacy to germinate In the spirit of the Halloween season North Korea decided to spook the rest of the world as it would prank the unsuspecting nation of Japan by firing long-range ballistic missiles over the country These missiles in particular were infused with even more holiday cheer when it was reported that they were capable of storing nuclear warheads The nation's 15 minutes of fame was prompted by U.S. and South Korean joint military exercises within the region which have been ongoing for the past several months On the morning of 3rd October, residents of the Tohoku region of Japan were alerted by siren to seek cover from an overhead missile which was heading straight for the island The high alert was quickly followed by railways shutting down and buildings quickly being evacuated However, just 5 minutes after its launch from mainland North Korea it made its way over Japan and after another 40 minutes landed harmlessly into the Pacific Ocean The missile was the first fired over Japan in the last 5 years but considering the nation's history with nuclear weapons it's made many Japanese citizens understandably nervous Unlike Russia, who has currently been downplaying its level of military involvement North Korea has been very direct in its recent show of force claiming that the recent missile test were to simulate attacks on South Korea and other high priority targets such as seaports, airports and military bases North Korea has done no nuclear testing since 2017 however, watchdogs and global authorities are on high alert Japan, South Korea and the United States have reaffirmed condemnation for the actions of North Korean leadership and have vowed to further reinforce their own defensive capabilities in retaliation North Korea has launched more ballistic missiles this year than any other year previously with 25 launches being recorded According to the Economist's Democracy Index the nation now sits as the third least democratic country in the world beaten by only Myanmar and

weaponizes a swarm of bees to fight police officers In a perhaps unexpected turn of events the first week of this month saw Revolutionary War hero and current US President, Joe Biden announce that he would pardon all Americans who have been convicted of simple marijuana possession and begin the review process for the federal legalization of the plant The United States has had a long and turbulent history with marijuana over the past century Marijuana, the burning weed with its roots in hell Making the drug illegal in 1937 and it wasn't until 2012 when Colorado and Washington would legalize it for recreational use all these years later Although being far less harmful than other socially accepted drugs marijuana has long been vilified within the United States and many have argued that its association to minority groups have made it a convenient cover for increased arrests According to ACLU, roughly 8.2 million US citizens were arrested for simple marijuana possession between 2001 and 2010 and although white people were up to 10% more likely to use the substance they were also 3 and a half times less likely to be arrested for possession as opposed to other non-white citizens Those against legalization point to its negative health consequences its function as a gateway drug, its likelihood to increase crime and the fact that marijuana consumption tends to increase when it becomes legalized In terms of health consequences, this is certainly a valid concern Marijuana use can lead to respiratory issues, declining mental health and by its very nature, it tends to make people quite a bit slower on the draw Its reputation as a gateway drug has also been a subject of debate as although its use has been positively correlated with the use of other drugs it's been hard to prove whether this is from the drug itself or whether people who use marijuana are already more likely to try other substances anyway As for increased crime, research suggests that rates of crime tend to decrease after legalization has occurred as not only does it dramatically reduce the incentive to sell the drug illegally but as it turns out, people tend to be a lot less inclined to commit violent crimes when they're armed deep in a can of Pringles As for legalization increasing consumption, this usually tends to be true however, it also tends to significantly reduce the use of harder drugs such as opioids Advocates of marijuana legalization also argue that it costs over $30,000 a year to incarcerate a single person and that not only would it save a huge amount of tax dollars but its legal sale would add billions to the US economy and make sure the drug is better regulated for consumption A Gallup poll from 2021 saw legalization support at an all-time high, with 68% among US adults With the mid-term elections in just over a week, some speculate that this push for legalization is Joe Biden's secret weapon right before the polls open and although it might not change the minds of many of his opponents 71% of independent voters are in favor of such reform Upon hearing the push for legalization, one of our writers would go on to announce This humble intern is lighting one up in the name of Dark Brandon As always, a list of all sources used will be in the description As expected, the Iranian protests continued into the month of October which has left the overall death toll for both demonstrators and security forces at over 200 To recap the situation, the unrest started when a 22-year-old woman, Masa Amani was arrested by the nation's morality police for violating the country's strict clothing laws for women Ms Amani later died after three days in custody and although officials ruled the cause of death a heart attack anyone else with more than two brain cells to rub together could tell she had been beaten to death The death of Masa Amani appeared to be the last straw for many citizens within Iran and initial protests in solidarity with her family quickly expanded into demonstrations for expanded rights and a general decline in the quality of life for the average Iranian October saw protests spread to all provinces across the country, including hundreds of universities some of which have remained relatively tame, while others were met with violent force Students demonstrating inside the nation's prestigious Sherif University were surrounded by riot police for several hours, trapping them inside, leaving Siminjed, and arresting a handful of others These kinds of crackdowns have become commonplace within Iran However the most egregious instance was in the city of Zahidan where clashes with police would lead to security forces firing indiscriminately into a crowd killing anywhere between 66 to 96 people The massacre, now known as Bloody Friday by locals was largely concealed from the rest of Iran for several weeks following a nationwide internet blackout designed to stop protesters from organizing Like many other wide-scale protests we've previously covered, Iranian citizens have developed their own techniques for how to keep themselves anonymous It's become general practice to demonstrate without a phone, as being arrested could lead to a person incriminating themselves Furthermore, filming security forces can paint a target on a person's back which has a very real threat of being met with very real bullets Some protesters have also started packing a change of clothes as guards will often use paintball guns to mark demonstrators for arrest Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has ruled over the nation for over 30 years and the 83-year-old has been characterized by his religious fundamentalism, liberal use of killings, and views on women that would make your incel co-worker look like a feminist icon Khamenei has generally dismissed the protesters as rioters and have warned that those who seek to sabotage the nation of Iran are deserving of harsh prosecution and punishment The supreme leader would also blame both Israel and the United States for the protests stating that the demonstrations were a design by these nations to destabilize Iran He would then go on to say that if Masa Amani hadn't died, another excuse would have been used to destabilize the country Whether Iran is heading towards more intensified unrest is too soon to say as on one hand, the conditions within the country have made it the perfect breeding ground for anti-government protests but at the same time, you don't spend three decades in power in a country like Iran without knowing how to crack down on a growing opposition As always, we'll be following this story as it unfolds, going into the future More details regarding the Jackson-Mississippi water supply have surfaced this month, a story which has been making headlines since June this year In the middle of the year, the water treatment facility in Jackson was damaged and rendered inoperable following flooding from the nearby Pearl River The facility was subsequently left entirely shut down until the middle of September leaving roughly 150,000 people in the richest country on earth having to boil their water for a three-month period How this was allowed to happen in the first place might be less surprising than you think as an investigation pointed toward a combination of crumbling infrastructure, outdated technology, and good old-fashioned corruption by local officials The treatment facility itself had been issued multiple citations by the Environmental Protection Agency over the last ten years as due to the dysfunctional and outdated equipment, the entire facility couldn't do the one fucking job it was designed to do Unlike your failure to win your competitive matches in Overwatch 2, the problem with the treatment facility wasn't a skill issue, but rather, a question of funding The incumbent mayor of Jackson, Shirkway and Tarloomamba had previously requested 35 million from the state government to explicitly repair the high priority damage In an interview, the governor of Mississippi, Tate Reeves, claimed the state had sent over 200 million over the past six years to the city of Jackson specifically for repairing and updating the water system This is in conflict with state and local financial records however, which indicate that 79.8 million was provided as a loan to the state government while the rest of the money was from a combination of Jackson's own budget, as well as direct federal funding This money was also allocated for the general funding of the city itself, as opposed to directly funding its water system and when considering the city's annual budget is only around 300 million anyway, it's not hard to see how the problem became so bad Jackson certainly isn't the first time that Americans have been left drinking unsafe water, as according to Maura Allaire, a professor at the University of California Irvine anywhere from 10 to 45 million Americans have suffered from unclean or unsafe public water systems since 1985 In some cases, lead pipes and outdated infrastructure have led to water becoming outright toxic while in other areas, the effects of climate change have altered water temperatures to be more hospitable for harmful bacteria The systems to fund these types of critical infrastructure projects could also be seen to be lacking Local and state governments raise most of their revenue from sales taxes, and most of this comes from property tax As you might be able to guess, as Jackson is one of the poorest cities in one of the poorest states in the country they are generally going to be left with a lot less than other comparable cities Two congressional committees are currently investigating the Jackson water crisis, and we'll likely know more about how something like this can happen sometime in the future To some more light-hearted news, we now move on to the war in Ukraine, which we'll start with a fun mystery On the 8th of October, an explosion occurred on the roadway of the Crimean bridge, causing parts of the structure to collapse The bridge, opened in 2018 by Vladimir Putin himself, is the longest in Europe, spanning 19 kilometers and costing the equivalent of 3.7 billion US dollars enough to run the US military for nearly two whole days However, the significance of the bridge goes beyond big numbers, as it was initially built after Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea in 2014 in an attempt to connect mainland Russia to this newly invaded territory In terms of who caused the explosion, your guess is as good as ours The most obvious culprit is Ukraine, however, the Ukrainian foreign minister rejected these claims, stating that the bridge is too heavily protected for their forces to attack Another explanation was that the attack was an inside job from Russia to stir up more internal support for the war, which might explain why half the bridge is still operational With this in mind, experts say that it's unlikely that Russia would damage its own critical infrastructure, especially when it's losing ground in the war Other explanations could include Ukrainian black ops groups, or even Russian citizens sympathetic to Ukraine within the war It's also possible that Ukraine simply didn't want to take credit for the explosion, as civilian casualties would be damaging for its support on the world stage As of time of writing, we are still left to speculate Speaking of foreign support, the Biden administration would send an additional 725 million in additional security assistance to Ukraine, putting the all-time figure at 18 billion since January this year The latest round of assistance includes smaller arms and ammunition, but most notably, High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS These weapons systems have been some of the most defining of the conflict, and have allowed Ukrainian forces to rapidly fire precision rockets, hundreds of kilometers behind Russian front lines Western allies were initially concerned at even giving Ukraine access to HIMARS in the first place, arguing that they could be used to destroy targets within Russia itself However, there have been no instances of this happening so far Foreign support has so far been vital for Ukraine in its war against Russia, which has both crippled Russia with increasingly tight economic sanctions, as well as providing Ukraine the equipment needed to continue fighting Within the United States, support for the war is still mostly positive, with a Gallup poll conducted in August, showing that 66% of US adults were in support of Ukraine reclaiming territory Even if it prolonged the conflict, while 31% were in favor of ending the conflict quickly, even if it meant allowing Russia to keep territory from the peace deal Those favoring a fast resolution to the war argue that it would ultimately stop more bloodshed from occurring, and that the United States shouldn't be spending billions of dollars on even more conflicts on the other side of the world The United States, in support of Ukraine reclaiming territory, have argued that Russia is the clear aggressor, and that if gone unchecked, it would invite more of these kinds of expansionist campaigns There's also the argument that the United States is one of the biggest winners of the war in Ukraine, as not only do they get to significantly strengthen their reputation on the world stage, but they can also bring back their Saviour of Europe badge that they haven't been able to wear for the past 80 years Not only this, but with a comparatively miniscule amount of money, they've been able to essentially cripple one of their biggest rivals both economically and militarily, and do so without losing a single US soldier in combat Cold War era presidents would be frothing at the mouth to be able to beat Russia this cheaply, as this is effectively the equivalent of holding a magit at arms length This month also saw the introduction of a new weapon into the conflict, as Russia employed kamikaze drones to the front line These kamikaze drones are known to be particularly difficult to counter, as they're capable of loitering in a predetermined location for extended periods, before crashing its 50kg explosive payload into an enemy target The drones themselves appear to be a way to get around sanctions of components used in more traditional munitions, as Western intelligence almost immediately identified them as being made by Iran US allies have voiced condemnation for Iran supplying such weapons, not only because they're supporting an expansionist war, but because by supplying these drones, Iran is in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2231 Without getting into too much detail, the resolution was basically an agreement for Iran to stop trying to make nuclear weapons in exchange for Western allies to stop crippling their entire economy with sanctions Part of this deal was to bar Iran from transferring or selling certain military technology, which is exactly why the United States has called the transfer illegal With this in mind, Russia is currently in the process of invading a neighboring country, and Iran security forces killed over 200 protesters in the most recent wave of anti-government demonstrations As both of these nations are currently being piper-perried with sanctions anyway, it stands to reason that neither really have much to lose from this transaction With winter in Ukraine fast approaching and with no end in sight, it's likely that the war will slow down over the colder months before eventually intensifying when the weather becomes more conducive to combat In any case, we expect to be covering this conflict long into the future In terms of final announcements, there isn't much to talk about at the end of this month, however next month, we should have something very special indeed As always, we'd like to thank our very generous Patreon

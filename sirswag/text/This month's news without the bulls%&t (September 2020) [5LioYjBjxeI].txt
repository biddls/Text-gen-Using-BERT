September's news was made possible by 584 Patreon supporters and by our proud sponsor, Surfshark VPN. The 1st of October marks a very special day for the series. Exactly a year ago, I announced that due to every single news video being branded as unsafe for advertisers, there was no way it could continue in its current state. Since then, viewer support on Patreon has grown a staggering sixfold and allowed the budget for a small, but dedicated news team to make the series infinitely more ambitious than what I could have created alone. The channel now stands in one of the most unique positions on the platform, as despite being able to generate zero ad revenue or even be recommended by YouTube at all, we are however, free to explore whatever topics we please, knowing full well that concepts like safe for advertisers or copyright infringement now mean absolutely nothing. that mask you use and did you think the stroke will never win well look at me i'm coming back again i got a taste of love in a simple way and if you need to know while i'm still standing don't you know i'm still standing better than i ever did looking like a true survivor feeling like a little kid i'm still standing yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm still standing yeah yeah yeah i'm still standing yeah yeah yeah i'm still standing yeah yeah yeah As always, we'll try to keep COVID-19 news to a minimum. As of the last day of editing, here are the current confirmed cases worldwide. The United States continues to maintain its lead in both confirmed cases and deaths, however, India has now overtaken Brazil to claim the silver medal position. The nations of Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Peru have all seen worrying spikes over the past month, as South America continues to be one of the hardest hit continents on Earth. Fortunately, many other areas of the world are having better success containing the virus, and treatments and remedies are making promising advancements in their clinical trials. A forecast by the University of Washington, cited by the White House Task Force for Coronavirus, has projected the US death toll to roughly double to 410,000 by the start of January 2021. As raw numbers have a habit of being lost in translation, we thought it would be appropriate to give a comparison to such a figure. In the film, Team America, a terrorist attack is comedically described to be unbelievably catastrophic, with the line, it would be 911 times a hundred. Based on these figures, the death toll is projected to be 25% higher than what this movie has tried to portray as an unreasonable loss of life. In case this isn't quite sobering enough, by the end of the year, daily deaths in the United States related to COVID-19 are predicted to reach just short of 3,000, which would be the equivalent to 9-11 happening every day, week after week, until the outbreak is under control. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stressed that if US citizens adopted mask use, to the same levels seen in nations such as Singapore, it would decrease the cumulative death toll by 122,000 by the end of the year, which is roughly double the US death toll from the Vietnam war. Global fatalities worldwide are expected to reach 2.8 million by the end of the year, roughly triple where they are at present. The first week of September saw as many as 100,000 citizens of Belarus take to the streets in the capital city of Minsk after the nation's president and presumably used car salesman, Alexander Lukashenko, obviously rigged the election in August. Since fleeing the country later that month to neighboring Lithuania, opposition leaders Witlana Tikhanovskaya, claiming to have won between 60-70% of the election vote, has appealed to the United Nations to impose sanctions against Alexander Lukashenko. After an embarrassing mix-up of a military blockade being put outside of the house of Harry Potter's uncle, the United Nations voted to issue travel bans and outset freezes on a list of 40 Belarusian officials who were implicated in rigging the election. These sanctions were however blocked by the island nation of Cyprus, who refused to sign the agreement unless the European Union also took action against Turkey, drilling in contested waters in the eastern Mediterranean. There's a reason that ejection votes in rounds of Among Us don't need to be unanimous. The opposition leader, also called for the creation of a coordination council, aimed to handle the transfer of power from Lukashenko and into a new provisional government. Applications to be members of this council were opened up to all Belarusian citizens, who could be considered as a trusted authority figure, such as a doctor, teacher, business leader, or author. Eventually, a council of seven people were selected as heads of the coordination council, so let's make some introductions. Liliyev Lesova, the well-known Belarusian lawyer and mediator, was arrested on 31 August by riot police. Olga Kovalkova, activist and former presidential candidate, was imprisoned for 10 days before escaping to Warsaw. Sergei Dylewski, the engineer, was detained while attempting to support a strike at a tractor factory in the capital. Pavel Litushko, the former minister of culture, escaped to Poland after being questioned by authorities. Maria Kolesnikova, musician and politician, avoided forced deportation by tearing up her passport at the border. She was later blindfolded and told she would either leave the country alive or in pieces. Maxim Znack, a career lawyer, was taken by men wearing ski masks on 9 September, only having enough time to message the word, masks, before his phone was confiscated. He was then taken to an undisclosed location, inaccessible to his lawyer. The last head of the council is Svetlana Alexovich, an author and former Nobel Prize winner, and the only member who has not been detained or forced into exile. Widespread protests demanding the resignation of Alexander Lukashenko have already seen several thousand arrests, and many who have been detained have accused police officers of beatings and torture. While this was happening, Mr Lukashenko took a trip to the far west Russian city of Sochi to speak to a lie and political dad, Vladimir Putin. Mr Putin announced that the people of Belarus should resolve the current crisis without foreign interference, and then immediately contradicted his statement by loaning Alexander Lukashenko one and a half billion dollars. In an interview with Russian journalists, Mr Lukashenko warned that if his government fell, Russia would be next, which is presumably referring to similar anti-government demonstrations in several Russian cities over the last few months. These types of protests have often led to similar types of suppression, as seen in Belarus, which leads us very neatly into our next story. Last month, we covered the incident involving Alexei Navalny, an anti-corruption activist and opposition politician to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was put into a coma after a suspected poisoning. The comatose Navalny was then held at a Russian hospital, and after a standoff between Russian doctors and a German charity, was eventually transported by plane to a specialist clinic in Berlin. Seventeen days after the incident, it was announced that Mr Navalny had come out of his coma, and a spokesperson later announced that he would be returning to Russia once he was in a condition to do so. Upon running a number of tests, the German government announced that Alexei Navalny was poisoned beyond reasonable doubt with a nerve agent, which is similar to ones previously used against another enemy of the Russian state, in 2018. It was later found that traces of the nerve agent were detected on an empty water bottle in his hotel room from the morning he was poisoned. Russian officials had denied any such allegations of the poisoning, and any self-respecting news organization wouldn't dare make such an accusation without concrete evidence. Luckily, the swag news team isn't a self-respecting news organization, so we can say without reasonable doubt that the Russian government absolutely did that shit. A report by the Pew Research Center has found that the proportion of young American adults living with their parents is the highest since the Great Depression. 52% of all adults aged 18-29 were found to be living with one or both of their parents in the month of July, and now places the overall number at 26.6 million, or more than the entire population of Australia. The trend of adults moving home has been at least partly attributed to the COVID-19 outbreak, and the research suggests that this general increase has been reasonably indiscriminate based on race, gender, and region. The report has also theorized that because roughly 75% of Gen Z rent their places of residence, this is likely to have a significant impact on the rental market, especially in urban areas. Details of a Sydney man who had a very unfortunate day have finally been unveiled. On the 23rd of July last year, Mr. Simon II jumped in his white courier van and started driving his delivery route. Very unfortunately, Mr. II would hit not only one, but two clearly marked, unoccupied police cars, which would cause serious damage to both. Deciding that the best course of action would be to drive off, the police then tracked down Mr. II using witness testaments and surveillance cameras, and later pulled over the courier further up the road. The startled Mr. II appeared to be acting suspiciously when questioned by the officers, which eventually led to the police searching his van and finding 273kg of crystal meth, with an estimated $200 million redo street value. In a statement, the New South Wales police, called the incident, one of the easiest drug busts ever made, and the very unlucky Mr. II, was sentenced to six and a half years for supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.

Following the record-breaking Australian fires from the start of this year, which burned a land area equivalent to the entire nation of Syria, South America has joined in on the trend, with the world's largest tropical wetland, losing at least 10% of its flora to an unforgiving blaze. The Pantanal, which mostly resides within the borders of Brazil, have lost over 12,500 square kilometers between January and August this year, beating its 2005 previous record by over 3,000 kilometers burned in the biome over the same period. The Brazilian Amazon to the north has also seen its fair share of wildfires, and much of the blame has fallen on Brazil's president and frequent face of the channel, Jair Bolsonaro, who viewers might remember as being staunchly against Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, which led to the nation getting the silver medal for most Covid cases, followed by he himself becoming infected. Mr Bolsonaro has become notorious for prioritizing economic growth in the region, often at the expense of environmental protections, and much of this forestation loss has been attributed to land clearing by local farmers. In August of last year, the European Union threatened to pull out of monumental trade deal. After President of France, Emmanuel Macron, accused Mr Bolsonaro of lying about his stance on climate change. Both Germany and Norway have since halted their payments to the Brazilian government's Amazon fund, and more than 16 trillion in assets from the European continent has since been threatened to be divested away from the region if rampant deforestation is not adequately prevented. This time last year, the nation's environmental minister put forth a plan that would allow wealthy countries to pay farmers $120 per hectare to not clear and develop their land, which was seen to be a promising system that can be applied to a fifth of the entire Amazon rainforest. This kind of incentive does however fail to take into account that 90% of all deforestation in the Amazon is illegal, meaning it would be entirely ineffective unless the South American nation seriously steps up its law enforcement for illegal land clearing. The investigation into the unprecedented blaze in the Pantanal was spearheaded by a collaboration between the New York Times and NASA, and used a new system that allows fires to be tracked in real time using satellite data. One might assume that an analysis conducted by both arguably the most successful newspaper and space agency in the world would be foolish to refute, however, Mr Bolsonaro, not one to take criticism lying down, stated that some of the flames detected were probably just campfires. The SWAG News team's own science division concluded that if every scrap of Mr Bolsonaro's IQ was by some unexplainable anomaly converted into Celsius, it wouldn't even come close to the heat needed to start even the smallest of blaze in the driest regions of the Amazon. The continued disregard for Amazon conservation presents itself as a continued concern, with the rainforest contributing 20% of all oxygen produced by photosynthesis on land. Never a nation to be outdone, the United States also saw huge swaths of land, devastated by wildfires on the west coast of the country. The nation has been experiencing intermittent wildfires since the start of the year, however, September marked one of the most destructive and recent memory, particularly across northern California. Talking to The Guardian, climate scientist Daniel Swain explained that the fires began because of an extended heat wave, with the appropriately named Death Valley reaching temperatures of up to 54�C, or 130 freedom units. The heat wave was then followed by a series of tropical storms, and then by yet another heat wave, and as of time of writing, 3.5 million acres of land have been scorched. Although climate change isn't explicitly responsible for starting fires, with that title going to stupid traditions for stupid people, climate scientists unanimously agree that the human impact on the climate has made it easier for these fires to thrive over a longer period of the year. The irony-loving swag news team would like to note that the Democratic governor of California, Gavin Newsom, has signed as many as 48 fracking permits since the beginning of January and a grand total of 4,545 oil drilling permits since taking office in 2019. The practice of extracting fossil fuels is not directly responsible for these fires, and by extension, the half a million people forced to evacuate, but it certainly doesn't do the situation any favors. Air quality in many western states went on to reach hazardous levels due to the overwhelming blaze, and the previously mentioned California governor compared it to smoking 20 packs of cigarettes a day. The stark images of the blood-red sky serve as yet another reminder of how nature should be feared, but more importantly, unconditionally respected. On September 14, a nurse from Georgia's Iowon County Detention Center blew the whistle on serious violations within the facility, which is used to hold immigrants who have illegally entered the United States. The whistleblower from the privately owned detention center detailed how one doctor was employed within the facility to carry out a variety of procedures and earned the malicious nickname, the uterus collector. The doctor in question was known to perform hysterectomy procedures far more often than is necessary, which is where the patient's uterus is either fully or partly removed. Hysterectomies are usually only reserved for a handful of very specific circumstances and leads to the patient becoming sterile. From the whistleblower, it appears as if all women who underwent these procedures either did not consent or did not understand what was being done due to the language barrier. The whistleblower compared the facility to an experimental concentration camp and shared specific accounts of patients not given enough anesthesia or being told they'd be having a minor 20 minute procedure only for the doctor to remove their entire womb. It was then later discovered that the man conducting these operations wasn't even certified to perform them in the first place. As of time of writing, it hasn't been confirmed whether the other 200 ICE detention centers are abiding by the same practices, but what's certainly clear is the doctor within this facility is obviously trying to speed run breaking every single domestic and international law under the sun. Over 50,000 immigrants are being held in such detention centers as of 2019, and a total of 193 people have died in ICE custody under all three administrations since 2004. Meanwhile, an anti-vaccination group sues Facebook after claiming that fact checking is a form of censorship, the American Food and Drug Administration reminds citizens not to drink hand sanitizer, and iPhones now have access to a feature first invented in 2008. Since the United Kingdom left the European Union in January of this year, a countdown started for the nation to quickly renegotiate its relationship with the rest of Europe. The UK has until 31 December to strike a deal with the European economic bloc it was once part of, but many experts are predicting that the likelihood of such an agreement being made in this time is close to zero. If this were to happen, the UK would automatically drop out of the EU's main trading agreement, which currently prevents all participants from charging tariffs on each other's goods, which makes it much easier for cross-border trade to take place. Failure would likely put the UK at a huge disadvantage within the region, as goods would become more expensive and harder to sell, and border checks would make shipping times likely much longer than currently enjoyed. The decision to leave the European Union was made via referendum all the way back in 2016, and passed with 52% of citizens choosing to leave, with the promise of a better immigration system, a greater ability to control the nation's laws, and a better quality of life, spurring the nation away from the rest of the continent. The economic effects of leaving have not however been as fruitful as leaving advocates would have hoped, as new researchers predicted that Brexit will have cost Britain an estimated �200 billion by the end of the year. For the same price, the UK could have built another international space station, which is currently the most expensive man-made object ever made, and still have �85 billion left over. Alternatively, they could have rented the entire country of Liechtenstein at $70,000 a night for nearly 10,000 years. As much of the value of leaving the European Union isn't tied to monetary value, the United Kingdom may need to spend an extended period separated from the rest of Europe to see the more intangible changes of its decision to leave. Back in January, we covered the story of Australian man, Dean Fletcher, who was arrested for organising a pool party at the Prime Minister's house before joking he would defecate in his pool. This was in response to the Prime Minister's famous mishandling of the record-breaking bushfires near the start of the year, which as previously mentioned, left 186,000 square kilometres burnt, an estimated billion animals left dead, and this firefighter particularly upset. We were previously fortunate enough to interview Mr Fletcher earlier in the year, but only this month it was revealed that his initial punishment of up to six months in jail was instead reduced to just a $400 fine. The judge on the case said that the biggest crime committed during his trespass might have been killing a few ants in the garden. This is what Mr Fletcher told the SWAG news team when we spoke with him directly. This experience has shown me that in some cases, justice will prevail, and while I won't be engaging in any such protests this summer, I remain as concerned as I was at the start of the year that the nation still won't be up to the task of addressing the fires or helping the devastated communities. Australians are still living in tents and caravans, waiting on the promised assistance from the Morrison government. Australia will be lucky to survive these cascading climate and economic disasters intact, the power remains with the people who continue to pay attention to what is going on. Massive thanks to the SWAG team for the attention that has been given to the collapse of public trust in governments globally, keep up the good fight. Despite the fine, Mr Fletcher will always have the title of creating one of the greatest Australian memes of 2020. Viewers who want to see more of Mr Fletcher can find a link in the description. The US election is now only a month away, which has not only been a point of interest for political figures and media outlets, but also from government funded hacking groups from several nations around the world. Researchers from Microsoft have found hacking attempts from three separate nations, with both the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency confirming these reports, but stating that there was currently no evidence of any successful breach against election infrastructure. According to the Department of Homeland Security, these hacking attempts have the intended outcome of both undermining US democracy and influencing the election to be more favorable to their goals. The first nation attempting to hack key people of interest is Russia, which comes as no surprise following their successful leak of thousands of emails of 2016 presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. Russia's hacking strategy has however shifted from its previous tactic of spear phishing, which sends tailored messages to people in an attempt to trick victims into clicking malicious links, and toward brute force attacks, which basically sees hackers attempt to use a metric shit ton of password guesses in the hopes that they'll eventually get lucky. The US intelligence community believes that Russia is primarily influencing the election in favor of Mr Trump's campaign, which has involved spreading content critical of his rival, Joe Biden, and also boosting Mr Trump's candidacy on social media and Russian television. The second nation is China, who has been seen to target individuals who are closely associated with both opposing presidential campaigns and also people from the international affairs community. Chinese hackers are using known bugs on websites and have been primarily gathering information on people of interest. The intelligence community believes that China prefers that Mr Trump does not win the next election, as they perceive him to be unpredictable. The last nation is Iran, who has been unsurprisingly interested in organizations tied to geopolitical, economic, or human rights interests in the Middle East. Iran has also targeted both campaigns of the US election, and primarily holds the goal of undermining democratic institutions and the position of president, mostly through social media content. US intelligence suggests that Iran would have a preference for Biden to be elected, as they believe US sanctions on the nation would be more likely to continue under a Trump presidency. It should be noted that the US intelligence community believes that Russia is the only one of the three nations mentioned who is actively seeking to interfere with the election to benefit one candidate at the expense of another. However, every country involved with these hacking attempts have clear preferences on who they'd like serving in the Oval Office. If you're a person who's sick of hearing about US election candidates without getting a shred of information on what they actually intend to do, then rest assured, your Patreon dollars have been hard at work, as we're currently making a dedicated video breaking down the two candidates purely on their policies over the next four years. Viewers can expect this comparison video to be available before the end of October. The Chinese government, much like pretty much every single entry in this series, has once again committed even more violations of human rights. New evidence suggests that the authoritarian state is now operating a large-scale and mandatory vocational training program within Tibetan territory, forcing over half a million rural laborers into recently built training centers since the start of this year. The labor camps are said to teach Chinese language, work discipline, Chinese law, and aims to reform what officials call backward thinking. According to research by a German anthropologist, these camps are often enforced by indoctrination, intrusive surveillance, and harsh punishments for prisoners who fail to meet labor quotas. These findings stand next to other greatest hits human rights violations by the regime, which includes the systematic genocide of the ethnic Uyghur population and a crackdown on pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong. The international community has been slow to respond to the Asian superpower, and no coordinated push to stop these atrocities has yet been attempted on a large scale. Widespread calls have however been made for China to lose the right to host the upcoming 2022 Winter Olympic Games, with members of parliament in New Zealand, the Netherlands, and the UK all showing support for such a restriction. Some experts on foreign affairs have speculated that the Winter Olympic Games may just be the best way for other world powers to force China to cease such abuses, as revoking their right to host would prove to be a serious detriment to their international prestige. The next two years may prove to be particularly perilous for the Chinese government, as they may be forced into the uncomfortable position of choosing between being the centerpiece of one of the most coveted sporting events on earth, or oppressing minorities. Despite the continued torture, sterilization, and brainwashing of over a million ethnic Uyghurs in the northwest region of the country, this hasn't stopped Disney's newest film, the live-action remake of Mulan, from praising a handful of government departments who are personally responsible for carrying out these human rights violations in the end credits. The film has long received criticism, starting from all the way back in August of last year, when the Chinese-born American actress and Mulan lead, Yu Yifei, publicly expressed support for Hong Kong law enforcement, while pro-democracy protesters were taking to the streets over excessive Chinese influence within the region. However, the public relations nightmare for Disney would only become worse when journalists discovered that the routes taken by the film crews to travel to a set location would have passed, and been able to personally see at least seven such re-education camps, and the set itself was as close as 16 kilometers from the nearest internment facility. Critics of the film have also questioned its themes of supposed Han supremacy, which is the idea that all parts of China, including native Uyghur lands, should be governed and occupied by ethnic Han Chinese people. It is still yet to be seen whether these criticisms will have any effect on Disney's bottom line, especially since the Chinese market for film is soon to become both the biggest and most censored in the world. However, with rising condemnation from human rights groups and most recently US presidential nominee Joe Biden's campaign at the end of August this year, Disney may have to choose between its access to the enormous Chinese market or the western audience that it has catered to since its inception in 1923. If one thing is for certain, genocide is pretty fucking cringe. In more light-hearted entertainment, the 72nd annual Emmy Awards came and went this month, which sees a panel of critics and judges vote on a variety of categories pertaining to American television. In the drama category, Outstanding Lead Actor and Actress was won by Jeremy Strong from Succession and Zendaya from Euphoria respectively. Succession also beat the seven other shows to win the award for Outstanding Drama. The comedy category on the other hand was an absolute stomp, with Canadian show, Schitt's Creek, winning all four major acting awards, as well as overall outstanding comedy series. Other notable awards include Eddie Murphy, winning Best Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, John Oliver, winning Best Variety Talk Show, and Watchmen, taking home the Outstanding Limited Series Award. In technology, Microsoft's underwater data center has resurfaced after two years, submerged on the Scottish coast. The long cylindrical container was packed with 855 servers in May of 2018, and of those 855, only eight had failed in this time. The project lead for the experiment noted that this is a promising start to the underwater data center concept, as this failure rate is only an eighth of what is typical on land. The team has speculated that this heightened reliability may have been due to both the lack of human error, and the fact the capsules were pumped with nitrogen, which is less corrosive than oxygen. Underwater data centers have many more potential advantages, as not only are these submerged capsules much easier to keep cool, but they can be powered entirely by clean energy, and make use of the vast ocean real estate that cannot be used for anything else. Microsoft hopes that this kind of data storage system will be particularly attractive for customers who want to keep their data safe from natural disasters or civil unrest, or by people who just play a lot of Subnautica. A report by oil company BP has predicted that the global demand for oil may have already peaked as of 2019. The influential annual report predicts that the black gold that has powered economies for decades will be quickly replaced by clean energy alternatives, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric. BP hopes to also transition into similar substitutes, with an effort to be a completely carbon neutral energy company, by the year 2050, which lines up with similar plans made by US presidential candidate Joe Biden, to achieve net zero emissions within the United States, by the same year. The company has also committed to growing its low carbon investments by eightfold by 2025, and tenfold by 2030. Global oil demand was expected to peak at the end of the 2020s, but if this report is to be believed, Covid 19 may have accelerated green energy initiatives more than any amount of activism could have achieved. With the World Health Organization predicting that climate change is estimated to cause the deaths of approximately 250,000 people a year, from 2030 to 2050, Covid 19 might yet save more lives than it ultimately takes. Viewers may have noticed that there wasn't any gaming related news this month, and this was because we released an entirely separate video for this section a few days ago. There were a myriad of reasons for doing this, but the main ones were the sheer volume of game related news, sponsor obligations, and trying to appease YouTube's mysterious algorithm with content not involving genocide. If you'd like to see a comparison between the two upcoming consoles, or like to know the story of how a discovery in the 1920s led to a Venezuelan mafia forming in old school Runescape, then the link will be at the end of the video. We'd once again like to thank every single Patreon supporter who continues to carry the news on their shoulders, and we'd like to wish all viewers a happy October of 2020.

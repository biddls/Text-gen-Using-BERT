we first start with a fun covid 19 update As of time of writing, the number of total confirmed cases has passed 210 million While the total number of deaths has surpassed the 4.5 million milestone The podium positions for most confirmed cases still hasn't changed And nations currently experiencing significant spikes include Japan, the United States, and Thailand In terms of vaccination rates, Qatar, Portugal, Singapore, Uruguay, Spain, and Denmark have all reached an impressive 75% threshold Specific regions of the United States were particularly hard hit this month With some regions exceeding their ICU capacity, while some hospitals experienced severe shortages in liquid oxygen Quite astonishingly, according to data gathered by the Associated Press, vaccinated individuals in the US accounted for just 1.1% of all hospitalizations due to covid And since the delta variant began proliferating, nearly all lethal cases have been regulated to people who are unvaccinated Meanwhile, in the sheep-loving nation of New Zealand, the entire country goes into lockdown after one case was detected in the city of Auckland In more light-hearted news, the Olympic Games concluded earlier in the month With the United States in first, mainland Taiwan in second, Japan in third, the Great British Motherland in fourth, the Russian Olympic Committee in fifth, and Kangaroo Land taking sixth With this in mind, China has alternatively declared themselves the first place winners With their reasoning being that they consider Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau all part of China By that same logic, we at the SWAG News team would like to pronounce every single member of the Earth as citizens of Swagistan And therefore claim the number one position for ourselves Well done everyone, you should all feel proud In a UN climate report released on August 9, scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change told the world that we are already pretty fucked If water is wet, the floor is made of floor. The report detailed that human activity was unequivocally too blamed for the rise in global temperatures And that although some impacts have already been locked in, other effects can be limited with rapid cuts to greenhouse gas emissions Global average temperatures have already seen a 1.1 degree rise from pre-industrial levels, with the effects of such a change already being visible However, if that number reaches 1.5, experts predict that this is when things turn into destination fucked A 1.5 degree threshold could mean global food shortages from decreased crop yields, high fatalities from vector borne diseases, sea level rises, more intense tropical cyclones And a longer and more destructive fire season, among many other not so fun consequences One often underreported consequence of climate change is its economic impact, with a 2017 study finding that for every 1 degree Celsius increase in global average temperature It would cost the United States a whole 2.3% of its GDP, which in that same year would equate to 446 billion dollars Over time, this would be enough to make the war in Afghanistan look cheap by comparison As it currently stands, the earth is the warmest it's been for the past 3 million years And if every single country on earth isn't able to hit the goal of net zero emissions by the year 2050, the fear is that the rise in temperatures may trigger a feedback loop How this would happen is if it becomes hot enough to melt arctic permafrost, it could release 60 billion tons of methane currently trapped under the ice Which could slingshot the earth to a terrifying 4.4 degrees warmer than pre-industrial levels before the end of the century The US intelligence community released a report earlier this year on their 5 possible predictions for the future With the best results seeing an aggressive and unified push to curb the impact of climate change With the worst scenario predicting global food scarcity, societal upheaval, a humanitarian crisis that makes covid look small A horrifying slip into authoritarianism across the globe, and in the very worst of cases, complete destruction through nuclear war It should be noted that this is only under the worst of circumstances, and although there tends to be a lot of fearmongering about these types of issues This genuinely might just be the greatest threat a human kind will ever faced When there's an evil face to punch, humans tend to gain the ability to move mountains to overcome incredible odds But in the absence of something to hate, we are likely to just remain inactive until it's far too late As you might imagine, the most damning climate report to date would likely terrify nations the world over However, Australia, living up to its reputation of opposite land, embraced the thought of a Mad Max style hellscape Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has long had a history of climate denial in his career Having close ties to the coal industry, and once famously brought a lump of coal into parliament in 2017 Australia unfortunately has an embarrassing reputation when it comes to climate action With a report released earlier this year by Renew Economy, placing the nation dead last out of 193 countries scored As of time of writing, Australia has not committed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 And despite having the luxury of an entire continent filled with sun-scorched fuck-all The government is still choosing to build new fossil-fuelled power plants, as opposed to construct cheaper and infinitely more sustainable solar farms Prime Minister Scott Morrison has long had a reputation of being a less than courageous leader Having a close relationship with QAnon public figure, Tim Stewart, famously fucking off to Hawaii When the country faced its worst national disaster since World War II And according to an urban legend, shooting himself at Engadine Maccas on September 20, 1997 The SWAG News team has previously attempted to verify this report independently However we were unable to find solid or uni confirmation Viewers are as always free to find our extensive list of sources in the description A 24-year-old Hong Kong man has become the first person to be arrested under the infamous national security law Which was passed in June of last year As it's been a while since we've talked about the Hong Kong situation Let's start with a fun lesson in history It all started during the Opium Wars when the British fought for their noble right to sell the devastating drugs to Chinese merchants In exchange for tea and other prized Chinese goods The British, who were experts in raffle-stomping foreign armies, won the conflicts in a convincing fashion And as a result, took control over the region of Hong Kong However, not confident in their ability to properly defend the region The British agreed to instead lease Hong Kong for 99 years After which, it would return under Chinese jurisdiction The British wouldn't have to worry about security And the Chinese, who had ruled over the region for the past 2000 years Figured eventually getting it back without bloodshed was a pretty good deal From when the agreement was struck in 1898 Hong Kong rose to become a democratic colony Formed around the British system of governance And had cemented itself as an economic powerhouse And the center of international trade and commerce in Asia When the lease finally ended in 1997 The British returned Hong Kong to the Chinese authorities However, with the express condition that it would be allowed to keep its economic and political systems for 50 years after the transfer As you might imagine, many citizens of Hong Kong Who liked the concepts of democracy and human rights Didn't like the idea of the Chinese government taking over the region Which spurred an exodus of over half a million people before the transfer was made official For the most part, this agreement was upheld Until an amendment bill in 2019 would make it legal for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China And be tried under Chinese law As China didn't have the best reputation for a fair justice system Literally committing genocide on ethnic wedges in its northwest Xinjiang region This obviously didn't sit well with the people of Hong Kong And between the start of 2019 and the middle of 2020 Huge protests took place over the territory I was lucky enough to talk to some of the protesters at the time And the passion, creativity, and logistical coordination was borderline unbelievable And when considering that supposedly a quarter of the entire population were attending some of the rallies This was far from a small fringe outlook This momentum was dramatically halted in June of last year When China officially passed the infamous Hong Kong security law This law advocating for an independent Hong Kong could land citizens a lifetime sentence The damaging of public property would be treated as an act of terrorism And people suspected of breaking the law could legally be wiretapped and put under surveillance Not only this, but China also set up a national security commission within the region Hong Kong citizens could be tried in mainland China And trials could be conducted completely behind closed doors Perhaps the most insane introduction was that under article 38 of the security law It stated that foreign nationals committing these acts outside of China and Hong Kong Were also subject to its laws Meaning me saying the line It sure would be cool if the people of Hong Kong had human rights Would technically be breaking Chinese law This is where we finally come to where we are today Up until now, the national security law has mostly existed as a looming threat To stop Hong Kong citizens from getting too comfortable with going against Chinese authority Covid-19 and the threat of getting tried for terrorism for egging a bus stop Put a stop to these large demonstrations And our previous contacts in Hong Kong have since gone dark Likely for their own safety However, with the arrest of the 24 year old Tong Ahin Kit For the crime of wanting an independent Hong Kong It's likely that he's being used as an example for others who might have similar sentiments Another development this month was news that the biggest teachers union in Hong Kong was being disbanded After Chinese state media accused it of helping to infiltrate schools with politics When considering that the security law forces schools to sing the Chinese national anthem Report students with successionist views And even show propaganda cartoons in classrooms Such an accusation is pretty fucking laughable Even before the security law came into place A surveyed 40% of the population was considering emigration In response, pro-Chinese news outlets are attempting to scare citizens With the horrors of social justice and taxes in western countries Which is somehow supposed to be scarier than a lack of human rights And a government which seems to be using the book 1984 as an instruction manual The good news is that many countries around the world Have been happy to take in Hong Kong immigrants With the United States offering current citizens within the country An 18 month extension of their stay Australia offering fast tracked visas And the United Kingdom offering a path to citizenship for 3 million Of the 7.5 million citizens who currently live in Hong Kong When considering Hong Kong's highly skilled and educated workforce Its democratically inclined population And its notoriously hard working people It's not so surprising that so many countries would happily take them in with open arms With this in mind, another law was passed in April of this year Which grants Chinese authorities unlimited power To prevent people from entering or leaving Hong Kong for any reason Although on paper, this is only designed to combat illegal immigrants When considering this is the same authority who might give someone a terrorism charge For urinating on the side of a building It still gives cause for concern It's been a long time since we were able to cover any large scale protests from within the region But we wish all citizens of Hong Kong all the best In whatever paths they choose to walk This is something that hasn't been done Viewers who can cast their minds back to August of last year Might remember it being perhaps the most eventful month Of an already chaotic trip around the sun With our news entry being nearly an hour long With this in mind, we thought it might be fun to look back on a few of these stories And how they've developed over an entire year Perhaps the most insane of all headlines was the Beirut agreement Perhaps the most insane of all headlines was the Beirut explosion The consequence of 2,750 tons of improperly stored ammonium nitrate in the city's port district The explosion, which was stated to be around a tenth of the intensity of the bomb That decimated Hiroshima in World War 2 Was attributed to mismanagement at the port And government corruption, which failed to relocate the volatile cargo into proper storage The incident would unfortunately claim the lives of 218 people Leave 6,500 wounded And would do an estimated $15 billion in damage to the city At the time, there were many conspiracy theories suggesting That the explosion may have been triggered intentionally WWE superstar and former US president, Donald Trump Stated at a press conference at the time That the explosion was the result of an attack He didn't elaborate further, then left Another theory was that terrorist group, Hezbollah, was involved However, a lack of evidence and a spokesperson from the group denying involvement Seemed to similarly disprove this claim Although we still don't know the exact cause of the explosion The most likely theory is that it was ignited by dock workers welding near a door of the warehouse Because as the old saying goes Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity When talking to a citizen of Lebanon as recently as this month They claimed that the country has fallen into a state of disrepair With shortages of bread, medicine, and petrol A nearly worthless currency And an electricity grid, which only works 4 hours per day According to the United Nations The unemployment rate in Lebanon is more than 30% While over half the population now lives in poverty Next up we have the Belarus election Where we once again get to check in on still reigning president Nearly 20 year dictator And presumably used car salesman, Alexander Lukashenko Viewers might remember the election campaign between the long ruling self proclaimed dictator And his unlikely rival, Svetlana Sakhonovskaya An English teacher who took the place of her husband's campaign After he was disqualified on a bullshit techmicality Despite only registering as a candidate only a month before the election Independent polls had her expected to take as much as 95% of the vote However, when the official results were released It was found that Alexander Lukashenko had miraculously won over 80% of all ballots cast As anyone with two brain cells to rub together Could have figured out that the election was rigged Svetlana Sakhonovskaya decided that it would be best to flee the country To neighboring Lithuania Upon her arrival, she claimed to be the rightful winner of the election And would employ the help of a coordination council Made up of seven prominent figures still in the country To organize a peaceful transition of power From what we could find, all seven members were later abducted, detained, or forced into exile Since the pretend election The European Union have introduced several waves of sanctions on numerous Belarusian officials Essentially freezing any assets And banning them from entering or traveling through any European territories Despite the European Union not recognizing the election as either free nor fair This has more or less done fuck all To promote any change within the nation Independent media has been all but stamped out And NGOs and rights groups have been shut down With Mr. Lukashenko calling them bandits and foreign agents In recent months, Belarus authorities have come under criticism For forcing an Olympic athlete to seek asylum in Poland For her anti-government sentiments And using fighter jets to ground an aircraft containing a journalist critical of Mr. Lukashenko's regime As recently as this month The 26-year-old head of an NGO dedicated to helping citizens flee the country Was found dead and hanging from a tree in a park in Ukraine It might be easy to call this some unfortunate suicide But when considering he reported being followed shortly before his death A betting man would say that he was absolutely fucking murdered To this day, Belarus is often considered the last European dictatorship Another story making headlines a year ago Which seemed to fade into obscurity Was the US ban of popular video sharing app, TikTok The reasoning behind the ban Was that as the app was owned by the Chinese multinational company ByteDance And as it was able to gather such an impressive amount of user information It could pose a security risk for US interests The US government initially gave ByteDance 45 days To sell the app to a US based company To avoid such a ban However, Chinese users became concerned That such an acquisition would instead put the data of Chinese citizens at risk A month after the government threatened to ban the app completely TikTok struck a deal with computer software company, Oracle To be its cloud service provider An arrangement designed to guarantee that no US data would be sent to China That shit is crazy, I really don't like that game Stop playing APAC Fast forward to June of this year And silent film star and current US president Joe Biden Decides to officially revoke the looming ban And instead, launches an investigation Into whether it poses a threat to national security As it currently stands TikTok is banned in 5 other nations around the world But with today's sponsor, that probably doesn't matter If you're trying

police In an amphibious vehicle And an English priest sews his own mouth shut To protest against media tycoon And professional piece of shit Rupert Murdoch It's hard to argue that the most significant event this month Was the US withdrawal from Afghanistan And judging by how difficult it was To find a single fucking headline that wasn't somehow related to the event It's hard to argue With this in mind, perhaps a good place to start Is asking why US forces were in the country in the first place It might surprise viewers to know But the nation of Afghanistan has had a pretty unstable history When the Soviet Union withdrew from the country at the end of the 80s The ensuring chaos of warlords fighting for power Led a preacher by the name of Mullah Mohammed Omar And his band of merry men To start their own armed movement One dedicated to a more fundamentalist view of Islam The charismatic leader And his small group of 50 students Would quickly balloon to 15,000 Within a few months By 1995, this up and coming group called the Taliban Would eventually capture the capital of Kabul in 1995 From 1996, the Taliban would control roughly 90% of Afghanistan And would enforce a particularly strict version of Sharia law The kind where homosexuals were led on fire And women were more or less put under house arrest However, the Taliban weren't the only rising boy band in the region With now famous oxford dropout By the name of Osama bin Laden Leading another group called Al-Qaeda A militant terror organization Made up of Islamic extremists Although the two groups weren't directly related They were described as having a symbiotic relationship With the Taliban offering Al-Qaeda protection within the country In return for the group training members of their elite guard Life was pretty good for the Taliban And as long as you weren't a woman A homosexual, ethnic or religious minority Educator, enjoyer of human rights or democracy Or had any appreciation for any form of art There was nothing but good times ahead When Al-Qaeda gave the United States the vibe check of a lifetime The US gave the Taliban an ultimatum Either hand over the Al-Qaeda leadership And stop harboring any members of the group Or prepare to feel the full force Of America's unlimited money glitch Obviously the Taliban didn't decide to cooperate So when SEAL team 6 clapped bin Laden in 2015 And buried his arse in the ocean Like he was fucking Megatron The American public began to wonder Why US military presence should stay A sentiment that only got louder Over the next 6 years of occupation The US deciding to pull out Before hitting the 20 year mark Seems to be at least in some parts symbolic As there were literally soldiers on the ground Who never lived in a world where the world trade centers were still standing Despite having 2 decades To arm and train the Afghan government It seemed as if this installed power base fell down immediately After its US foundation began to withdraw The Taliban's lightning fast recapture of the country surprised even themselves And despite last month's estimates from US military experts That there was a moderate chance That the group would retake the country sometime in the next 2 years It appears that it was a surprise to US intelligence as well For the most part, the recapturing of the country was mostly bloodless With many of the soldiers of the Afghan army being underpaid And believing the Afghan government to be corrupt And ultimately ineffective It's not exactly surprising That choosing between risking their own lives For a flawed entity who couldn't even pay them properly And simply letting the Taliban peacefully take over their region of control Wasn't a hard decision to make For many of the soldiers on the ground The capture of the more relatively progressive capital Saw citizens quickly scramble To change into more traditional attire While huge traffic jams to the airport were formed As citizens attempted to flee the country The United States and its allies Have since been doing their best to protect Afghan citizens Who acted as interpreters during the war And are planning to grant tens of thousands of fast-tracked visas For citizens and their families This hasn't stopped the evacuation efforts Turning into an absolute clusterfuck With US embassy staff being elifted to the Kabul airport by helicopter After destroying sensitive information And three Afghan citizens falling to their deaths After desperately clinging to the side of military aircraft Meanwhile, the Taliban militia have been enjoying the spoils of war Left behind by the hasty exit of US troops With some decked out in full US military kit And others photographed on top of iconic Humvees However, according to service members familiar with the vehicles They estimate that their effective range without intense maintenance Is roughly 600 meters in ideal weather Perhaps the most amusing part of the Taliban takeover Are the clips surfacing of members enjoying the spoils of their victory With footage of them dancing, using a gym once reserved for US personnel And riding bumper cars With this in mind, none of these clips are nearly as funny As the Taliban publicly announcing That it intends to respect women's rights within the country Which is pretty much the personification of the meme Of Danny DeVito wearing a feminist t-shirt In terms of the international reaction to the takeover The United Nations wrote a very firm letter to the Taliban The European Union discussed an overhaul of its migrant asylum policy Canada has committed to resettling up to 20,000 Afghans Through a special immigration program And China has sought a friendly relationship with the Taliban Presumably to protect its own borders within the region As for the United States itself Political commentators have begun blaming one president or another For the fall of the country Going all the way back to Jimmy Carter But if there's one thing that can be universally agreed It's that whether America decided to pull out or not There was no situation It would have been able to declare a decisive victory Quite unfortunately The already extremely repressed citizens of Afghanistan Are likely going to remain so long into the future In many nations around the world Homosexuality has more or less become accepted by a large portion of society But for the most part, being gay is still considered to be unacceptable In the majority of countries Earlier this month A viewer brought to our attention a number of concerns he faced As a gay man living in Romania And looking into the story further We found an unfortunate trend of nationalist movements across Eastern Europe Jumping on the same bandwagon In June of last year Polish president, Andrzej Duda Was deadlocked in a tight race with his political rival And in order to pull ahead He ramped up the hate For LGBT citizens Vowing to ban the teaching of related subjects in schools And to deny same-sex couples The right to marry or adopt This wasn't the first time the rights of an entire group Were used as a political bargaining tool In 2001 Romania legalized homosexuality Not out of the goodness of their hearts But as it was a human rights requirement To join the European Union And enjoy all the perks the economic and political bloc has to offer Near the start of last year Russian president Vladimir Putin Also doubled down on the nation's anti-gay stance Formerly banning same-sex marriage in the country Although, it should be noted That Vladimir Putin changing the constitution Is more or less just a five-year-old Making up the rules for monopoly as they go along This was just the first time it was written down Although not being able to get married Doesn't immediately imply a complete ban on being gay Our source in Romania Detailed how life remains difficult for this group within the country It is very depressive To see your rights being taken away from you And there's nothing you can do I tried to reach out to the Romanian media To no avail Seeing people dehumanize you is awful It really got to a point Where I didn't feel like a person anymore Because gay people in Romania are treated like fairy tale monsters Like they don't even exist I don't want anything special I don't want the world I don't want money I just want to be able to go with my boyfriend to a restaurant And not be threatened with my life I want to be able to stay in the park And be cuddled with my boyfriend Without fearing somebody might attack us And knowing that if we do get attacked The police will just ignore us Because we loved each other A Pew research study released in June of last year Found that there was starting to become a slow divide In the attitudes of homosexuality around the globe As while many countries tended to show rapid acceptance Others appeared to double down on their anti-gay sentiments In general, the study did however, find some interesting trends As it turns out, attitudes on homosexuality were strongly correlated With the wealth and development of a country Showing that nations with a higher GDP per capita Were generally more accepting of gay rights Perhaps unsurprisingly, younger generations also tended to be more accepting across the board Although the degree to which, tended to vary by country Lastly, it appeared that education also proved to be a major factor Which appeared to be universal across the globe The Pew Research Center didn't make any conclusions for their research And as a result, neither will we Something something links in the description With the news over, it's finally time for some exciting announcements Firstly, we've done an overhaul of our Patreon page So in terms of those balance changes We've taken out one of the weaker video rewards And replaced it with perhaps one of the best we've made to date As promised, our guide on how to beat up 5 year olds has been made And

As always, we begin the month with a fun covid update Here are the current covid stats as of the last day of editing With the United States, Kangaroo land, and Thailand all experiencing a spike in cases Although we could delve deeper into exactly why these spikes are occurring It's alternatively a lot funnier to look at people with no medical degree Thinking they somehow know better than the combined knowledge of millions of people who do The latest of this trend was the use of a medication called divamectin An anti-parasitic drug for use in both humans and animals Although most commonly used as a deworming treatment for hoofed herbivores The drug's use has been promoted by none other than Joe Rogan and Alex Jones The latter of which has the lowest factual reporting rating I've ever seen since starting the series Not that we should have to tell viewers that a man famous for a homosexual frog-based conspiracy Isn't a trustworthy source of information With this in mind, there's actually a scientific basis for the use of ivamectin to treat covid With an Australian study in 2020 showing that ivamectin killed the novel coronavirus in a lab experiment The catch however, is that the dosage used for the experiment was lethal to humans Meaning although you could treat covid-19 in this way, you could alternatively just drink bleach to achieve the same results Ivamectin related incidents have flooded the United States Poison Control Center hotline Which has seen a 245% increase from the start of July With at least two cases of people put in intensive care after ingesting the drug As for the rest of us, we can all appreciate the irony that people who took the drug to be accounted to a herd mentality Literally did so by taking a drug commonly administered to sheep We couldn't make this shit up if we tried Moving away from breaking new records with covid We jump straight to records being broken for fucking insane weather As Hurricane Ida first introduced itself to the United States at the end of August Plowing its way through 17 states as well as Colombia, Venezuela, and the Caribbean The category 4 hurricane generated wind speeds of up to 150 mph or 250 km per hour for freedom hating communists watching And left 900,000 people in Louisiana without power, some for up to 3 weeks Select regions of the country experienced record rainfall over this period While some parts of the New York subway system were flooded for over 2 days The hurricane was so fucking big that it even created its own weather patterns across the continent for weeks after first hitting the coast And although we couldn't find consistent statistics anywhere, it seems as if the death toll likely sits between 115 to 147 As for structural damage, the cost to rebuild homes, businesses, and infrastructure is estimated to be at around 95 billion dollars We now move to the sunny state of Texas, otherwise known as Big Florida This month, the state legislature passed a bill which effectively banned abortion within the state past the 6th week of pregnancy And doing our best to keep within YouTube guidelines, didn't make exceptions for pregnancies which were the result of a crime While the bill didn't create a pathway to jail time for getting an abortion It allows citizens to sue any doctors carrying out the procedure or anyone aiding the practice in any way for an upward of 10,000 dollars This initially sparked fear among the drivers of ride hailing services, as they'd now be liable if they even unknowingly transported a woman to a clinic However these services later assured drivers that they'd personally pay for any damages imposed by such legal action This does however create somewhat of a loophole where a couple can get pregnant, sue the driver knowing that a tech giant will cover their arse, go through with the operation in another state, and rinse and repeat for an easy 10 grand a run The abortion debate has long been a contentious topic in the United States, with the famous Supreme Court case of Roe vs Wade often being cited The problem was that as the United States runs by following a document written in the 1700s, and because the founding fathers didn't think to include abortion when they wrote the constitution The decision was down to interpreting what was written by Washington's homies all those years ago What was ultimately determined is that the mother and doctor could do what they wanted up to the 12th week of pregnancy, after which states had jurisdiction if they wanted to intervene The reason that Texas is so significant is that the bill was upheld by the Supreme Court by a vote of 4-5, meaning there's now a pretty solid precedent if other states decided to follow this same decision We've covered the abortion debate before, and ultimately debate between the two sides tends to quickly break down, as the very concept is interpreted very differently depending on who you ask Abortion advocates argue that the practice has undeniable health benefits, as studies have shown that making the process illegal doesn't in any way affect the number of abortions carried out As women either travel to a location where it's legalized, or undertake the procedure in unsafe conditions Not only do an estimated 23,000 women per year die from these kinds of pregnancy-related deaths, but advocates also believe that there's a human rights element to the debate, with the question of bodily autonomy being a main centerpiece On the other hand, anti-abortion advocates are of the belief that a human life starts well before the threshold outlined by Roe vs Wade, which is where we start to see the problem with the abortion debate as a whole, as the subjective question of morality blurs all lines When the question of what it is to be human is a pivotal part of the discussion, we're not about to take sides in a debate as old as time, so viewers are as always free to make up their own minds Since the world became a big game of plague incorporated, governments from all over the globe have enjoyed a tied up news cycle to in many cases quietly pass some questionable laws The latest in this trend is Australia, which passed a law that allows law enforcement agencies to modify, add, copy, or delete data when investigating serious online crime As you might expect, digital interest groups weren't exactly thrilled at the possibility that a person's data could be monitored, deleted, and modified without them ever knowing, especially when the laws were rushed through parliament in only 24 hours On the surface level, the concerns are understandably justified, as there's seemingly nothing to stop a lazy investigator logging into the Facebook account of a suspected drug dealer, posting the words, I'm a drug dealer who loves selling drugs, before concluding the investigation before lunch Perhaps an outrageous example, but not all that unwarranted, which is coincidentally also a fun feature of the updated laws In certain circumstances, investigators won't even need a warrant to conduct such actions, and even if a warrant is officially acquired, people who even have loose connections to the person of interest can also have their online information monitored, deleted, and modified Furthermore, investigators will in some circumstances be able to compel any information on a target's computer to assist with hacking efforts, refusal of which could land them 10 years in prison According to the Human Rights Law Center, this fixture of the law may likely clash with an individual's right to freedom from self-incrimination Law enforcement agencies argue that these new laws are to keep pace with the technology that criminals have adopted, and that they're only intended to be used in the case of serious crimes such as terrorism and child exploitation The problem of course, is because of its broad language and swift implementation, the law is likely to leave a lot of innocent citizens vulnerable, with rights groups pointing to a particular lack of safeguards Whistleblowers and journalists are two of the main groups of interest, which is particularly relevant in Australia's recent treatment of both Australian army lawyer, David McBride, is currently facing 50 years in prison for leaking documents of alleged war crimes committed by Australian troops in Afghanistan, while another witness to similar incidents needed to be relocated after their house was bombed by a suspected former SAS operator On the other hand, journalists being targeted is seemingly part of Australian culture, with employee of YouTube creator, Friendly Jourders, being arrested by an anti-terror unit early this year, only hours after annoying Deputy Premier, John Berrellaro Furthermore, a 2019 raid on the offices of the nation's public broadcaster was enough to temporarily drop Australia's freedom rating from free to only partly free, meaning for an entire year, Australian citizens were only considered as free as people from France or the United States Perhaps unsurprisingly, the raid was in relation to war crimes committed by Australian special forces in Afghanistan, but that proud Australian tradition is a story for another day Unfortunately, there was very little pushback for the new surveillance laws passed at the start of September, as there were only a handful of articles to be found on the subject However, this isn't the first time such a controversial law has passed, seemingly unnoticed, and it certainly won't be the last One trend that might not be as well known as the 2016 scary clown period, or the 2017 obsession with fidget spinners, is the huge amount of environmental activists getting fucking murdered In fact, last year saw a new high point for the practice, which saw 227 people killed for holding such views, and since 2015, there's been an average of 4 activists getting killed per week Perhaps the most insane comparison to this level of violence is that averaging the stats from last year, over a two decade period, tree-hugging hippies were getting killed in higher numbers than US military personnel stationed in Afghanistan According to a report by Global Witness, around a third of these killings is in response to attempts to stop resource exploitation, such as protesting large-scale agriculture projects, mining efforts, and general infrastructure However, the most dangerous of these industries for these activists is claimed by logging with 23 murder cases within Brazil, Nicaragua, Peru, and the Philippines, only last year Global Witness has called on governments to formally recognize the human right to a safe, healthy, and sustainable environment, and have recommended protections for such activists to be a greater priority going forward The human right to an untainted environment hasn't yet been established, but it's been picking up a fair amount of momentum since COVID-19 took center stage Only earlier this year, legal experts began the process of making ecocide, a fifth international crime, joining the likes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes of aggression, as another offense to be universally frowned upon Although perhaps not as blatantly horrific as the other flavors of this shitty variety pack, legal experts argue that because the destruction of the environment has an effect on everyone on Earth, the consequences of intentional harm should reflect a debt owed to the whole of humanity The process of qualifying for a new international law is understandably long, but we'll be sure to revisit the topic if anything happens The report by Global Witness seemingly uncovered perhaps a deeper issue in environmental violence, with an overwhelming majority of the killings conducted in particularly repressed countries And it's feared that a huge number of other cases simply go unreported, owing to strict government control Furthermore, with 9 out of 10 of those killed being men, and 5 out of 7 being indigenous to the area, you start to see a pretty bleak picture of the type of people who are regularly murdered for their beliefs Of course, trying to stop dogshit governments who would consider the Geneva Convention a Geneva suggestion probably isn't going to work, which is why the European Union is drafting up laws that would hold companies accountable if any such violations were to happen in their supply chains It's the hope that this top-down approach will remove the incentives for larger-than-life operations to ignore these increasingly frequent deaths, as it will simply be far too expensive to do so Time will tell if such measures will prove as effective as today's sponsor If you're trying to remain

It's cheaper than the other ones Meanwhile, China imposes a masculinity mandate for the entertainment industry, North Korea calls for urgent action on climate change And an Australian drug addict dresses up as a police officer and raids another drug user's home for more drugs Last month, we covered what's likely to be remembered as the biggest fuckup of Joe Biden's career being the US evacuation of Afghanistan And we figured it would be fun to find out what's happening within the country now With American troops gone, along with their heavy weaponry and DLC, Biden's recent comments put the blame on the national army's failure to halt the rapid fall of the country Which even Stevie Wonder could have seen coming Fast forward through a few deadly terror attacks on the evacuating troops, Afghan citizens desperately clinging to military aircraft as they take to the skies And USS strikes that wiped out a bunch of children And it's likely the operation will be the subject of study in military academia for centuries to come Nations the world over are speedrunning fast-tracked visas for military translators and US assets Who helped American troops during the war, as many are now being hunted down by tally-bang forces Who now control the overwhelming majority of the country Gathered before the world's press and the presidential palace in the capital of Kabul, Taliban leadership declared that they were not the same organization they were all those decades ago And that they would be respectful of both human rights and the rights of women However, there may have been a translation issue, as reports now indicate that all female education after the age of 10 has been banned completely Which as you can imagine, doesn't do all that many favors for the nation's already horrific education ranking This stands for women's rights were solidified as absolute bullshit when women were banned from the nation's ministry of women Which was later replaced with the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice A department which became infamous for enforcing strict religious doctrine when the tally-bang had control over the country the first time around Other high ranking government positions were dealt out to particularly hardline members of the tally-ban And when considering we often talk about people in power being corrupt and ineffective, at least they didn't get to those positions of power Purely for being the biggest pieces of shit in a group exclusively made up of pieces of shit Although the Taliban's advance and takeover of Kabul went about as smoothly as they ever could have hoped, they are not without contention The old Afghan government has regrouped in the Panchir Valley, a well defensible position, with an estimated 5 to 20 thousand troops at the ready to resist full tally-ban control of the country With this in mind, the tally-ban have announced that it will be happy to establish relations with all countries around the globe, except for Israel Meaning that whatever Israel did to piss them off is more offensive than a 20 year occupational war The one condition for diplomatic ties however, is for quote, our values to be respected For many nations around the world, this has proved to be far too high of a price for any kind of relationship with the tally-ban With Canada most notably refusing to have any connection to the group While China on the other hand, who has a more indifferent approach to different governing styles, have embraced the new rulers of Afghanistan The Taliban currently considers China their closest ally on the international stage And when considering its close proximity and huge abundance of untapped resources, it's likely that this relationship will prove to be very fruitful for both Chinese and tally-ban interests After all, with a trillion dollars of minerals buried beneath the earth, and with a ton of political capital for the taking, this might just be a match made in heaven for the rulers of both parties Meanwhile, in the motherland, the British government intends to make it mandatory for all newly built homes and offices to come equipped with electric vehicle chargers, making England the first country on earth to do so The biggest drawback for electric vehicles is the severe lack of infrastructure to support them, however, it's the hope of lawmakers that this requirement will make it much easier to transition to electric vehicles over the long term The United Kingdom has already committed to outright banning the sale of non-electric vehicles by the year 2030, while the European Union seek to have 30 million electric vehicles on the road by that same year The European Union currently has around 200,000 charging ports over the whole continent, however, to meet the demands for this transition, 15 times this amount would need to be built before this decade is up The EU is currently aiming to meet the goal of net-zero emissions by the year 2050, and as the transportation sector makes up a quarter of this threshold, a push to make electric vehicles mandatory is one of the easiest ways to achieve this goal One of the side effects of this shift is even nations like Australia, whose parliament is almost unrecognisable from a scene in Mad Max, will likely become cleaner by default, as car manufacturers will need to adopt their business strategy to these new laws, or risk losing one of the biggest automotive markets in the world Of course, electric vehicles aren't without their environmental faults, as the extraction of rare earth metals and the production of batteries are also a huge driver of emissions Viewers may have even heard that electric vehicles are more damaging to the environment than petrol-powered offerings, however, this is the result of cherry-pick data at best, or fossil fuel propaganda at worst The truth is that although conventional vehicles are more environmentally sound to produce, they are ultimately much more damaging over the life of the vehicle when compared to a fully electric ride What's also true is that an electric car can only be as clean as the source of the electricity, however, even still, studies have found that even if electric vehicles were being charged exclusively from a coal-powered grid, they'd still achieve similar carbon emissions compared to a vehicle with an internal combustion engine As it turns out, the location of battery manufacturing also plays a significant factor in how clean an electric car can be, with US and European manufacturing techniques estimated to produce up to 66% less CO2 than their Chinese counterparts It's also hoped that factors such as economies of supply, more advanced recycling techniques, and the adoption of clean energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear will push electric vehicles even further into a clean future When the day finally comes, when net-zero emissions are achieved around the world, and we've ever so narrowly avoided the worst humanitarian disaster in recorded history, we can look back and attribute some of the praise to a country which unironically requires an up-to-date television license to watch Netflix On 5 September, military strongman, Mamededi Bouyar, led a military coup to take over the government of Guinea and would later announce the end of both the government and the constitution The nation of Guinea has never had much luck in the way of honest and effective leaders When the nation became independent from France in 1958, the country was subject to decades of autocratic rule. That was until 2010, when a man called Alpha Cond� became the nation's first ever democratically elected leader However, over time, this alpha male would slowly become just as autocratic as a people he replaced, and in 2020, he would make a change to the constitution, which would allow him to essentially reset his terms and stay in power much longer than intended This was the catalyst for a series of protests, which would result in several of his political opponents thrown in jail, dying in custody, or vanishing completely. It probably goes without saying, but a bunch of protesters also died, because that's just how this shit goes Changing the constitution to extend his term was basically like abusing an unintended glitch the developers never intended, and as long as the military had his back and the working end of an AK-47 was at his front, he could essentially stay in power as long as he liked That was until he began cutting funding to the military. As it turns out, the coup instigator, Mamedidi Bouya, was a former French Foreign Legionnaire, was trained by the Israeli military, served in the Guinean special forces, and was a qualified sigma male who never deviated from his sigma male grindset After the coup, the New York Times claimed that the mutinous soldiers had been trained by the United States, however, there's currently no evidence that the coup was planned by Uncle Sam The aftermath saw Guinness suspension from the African Union, a united nations-like body, which is somehow even less effective. Supposedly there was even celebrating in the streets after the military takeover, with Mamedidi Bouya announcing that there would be an 18 month transition period before a new government is elected into power, however, your guess is as good as ours on whether that will actually happen As almost all aluminium comes from barxite, and as guinea happens to have the world's largest reserve of barxite in the world, the price of aluminium climbed to a decades high Pretty good for a material, which sounds like something we just made up. In terms of the international reaction to the coup, pretty much every country with something to say, strongly condemned the actions of the mutineers, with Mamedidi Bouya responding, with quote, that's cool bro, but I don't remember asking Guinea serves as the fourth military takeover in Africa over the past 12 months, and it's rumoured that the fifth such incident will unlock a golden Kalashnikov rifle as a free login reward for all coup instigators involved As always, we'll be sure to keep viewers updated if any patch notes drop for such an eventuality Viewers might have noticed a lack of coverage for the nation of Myanmar lately, which is partly due to our only source wisely getting the fuck out of the country, but mostly because the stories that come out of Myanmar are what drives Brandon the writer to drink Viewers likely remember that wonderful dance video in February, wherein which, the military can be seen taking over the country in the background. As a recap, the military took over the country after the election showed just how unpopular they were, and since then, there's been protests, resistance movements, and a small civil war for people who didn't like their country being overthrown Most recently, two random guys were arrested in New York after attempting to assassinate Myanmar's UN ambassador. However, depending on who you ask, the country is in an awkward spot of having two UN ambassadors, the one that was nearly assassinated in New York, which was fired by the illegitimate military coup, and another, which was elected by the military to replace him. It's a weird situation to say the least. At the 76th United Nations General Assembly, an agreement was made between the United States and China to ban the Myanmar military from having a voice in the United Nations, but only on the condition that the legitimately elected UN representative also didn't get to say anything. The system works, and equality rippled throughout the globe. Meanwhile, within the nation itself, leader of the coup and war crime champion of the region, Funny Hat Man, declared himself prime minister before pushing back the first election of the regime by another two years. It's almost as if a man who's made famous for committing crimes against humanity doesn't give a shit about the concept of democracy. Several reporting groups much better funded than ourselves have estimated that over a thousand people have been killed since the start of the coup, but between you and me, that shit seems pretty fucking low. However, even a thousand people are dwarfed in comparison to the three million people in need of humanitarian aid, and the thousands of others who have been displaced or forced into fleeing the country entirely. As you can imagine, a government that only a few months ago had air-striked its own citizens, also doesn't have an effective plan against Covid, with as many as three to four thousand people a day dying, with reports of bodies being piled up in residential homes being an alarmingly common sight. The UN estimates that only 40% of the country's health infrastructure is still operational, however, our sources on the ground estimate that this number would be generous. Even so, it's hard to say in the first place, as internet blackouts to restrict information still exist across the country. Between 2005 and 2017, Myanmar was able to nearly half the amount of people living in poverty within the country, but when considering the military coup, an almost uncheck virus, and a government waging war on its own citizens, it's predicted that all of these hard-earned gains are likely to be reset by the start of next year. On the 6th of September, Indian news channel, Republic TV, broadcasted footage of an attack by the Pakistani Air Force in Panjshir Valley, a mountain province in Afghanistan that's currently the last major stronghold for anti-Taliban forces. The news source claimed that the military jet was attempting a bombing run while contending with an anti-aircraft gun, trying to bring it down. As it turns out, the footage used wasn't from Panjshir Valley or anywhere in Afghanistan, or even anywhere on the planet, but rather, it was footage of the military simulation game, Arma 3. By using the shitty crime detective method of enhancing the image, we can see that the footage was just so cropped and pixelated that either the news broadcaster was tricked by a dastardly gamer, or they just straight up fabricated the footage for a bump in ratings. Arma 3 developer, Bohemia Interactive, confirmed that the footage was indeed from their game, and even stated that this wasn't even the first time in-game footage had passed for bullshit news. In May of this year, gameplay was also used in an attempt to show a ground-to-air attack between Hamas and Israel, a conflict that garnered a particularly high level of fabricated claims. The CEO of Republic TV was previously arrested in December last year for allegedly rigging ratings in order to charge more to advertisers, and according to media bias fact check, the outlet doesn't even meet the standard of being mostly factual. With this being said, after comparing it to the three biggest outlets in the United States, they all appear to be rated the same on factual reporting, with Republic TV somehow rated as the most unbiased among all four. With this in mind, here's three corrections for last month's news that we admittedly fucked up, and a link to our source list is as always in the description. Just to prove even further that we do our research, here's our source for why we're better than the other news broadcasts listed above. With another month of news over, it's once again time for some announcements. Firstly, we'd like to thank everyone who participated in our third cancer for cancer fundraiser last month and attended the AMA session. As it turns out, a bunch of absolute degenerates can actually do some good shit for the world, so hats off to all who showed up. Next up, we have a lot of spicy videos planned over the next month that we've been saving for quite a while, so with a team finally at full strength, we should have something that might resemble a consistent month over October. Wouldn't that be a fucking treat? Finally, we'd like to give a huge thanks to our Patreon supporters who fund what we do, because there's no fucking way we would have lasted half this long if it wasn't for so many people sending some change our way. The next stretch goal is a poll completely out of our hands and will force us to make whatever video idea happens to produce the most votes. The stretch goal is currently 94% complete, so viewers who want to support what we do, get a few free videos, or force us to make whatever dumb shit video idea you collectively think is the most worthy can check out the links in the description. On behalf of the entire team, we'd like to wish everyone a happy October of 2021.

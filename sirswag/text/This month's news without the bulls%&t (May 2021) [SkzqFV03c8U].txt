As always, we start the news with a fun covid 19 update As of time of writing, the number of cases globally has reached 164 million, while the total number of deaths has reached 3.4 million The podium positions are still unchanged, however, humans are starting to speedrun vaccination efforts, with an estimated 1.54 billion vaccines administered globally, at a rate of roughly 25 million vaccines a day Nations currently experiencing an upward trend in cases include Nepal, Iran, and most notably, India Unfortunately, last month we failed to mention the biggest spike in localized cases since the start of the pandemic, encompassing many areas across the Indian subcontinent At one point, India even managed to surpass the United States in most covid cases in a single day, at over 400,000 in total The nation then went on to steal another record from the land of the free, having the most number of deaths in a single day, at over 4500 Indian infrastructure has struggled to keep up with such a huge increase in cases, with hospitals across the country suffering oxygen shortages and a lack of protective gear for medical staff Crematoriums have also seen a huge backlog of customers who have lost their families to covid 19, and the Ganges river, considered to be a holy land mark in Hindu faith, has been flooded with the remains of the dead India had previously been one of the more fortunate nations in terms of covid cases, but as the rest of the world starts to get better, it seems as if this region of the world will likely continue to suffer On the 7th of May, news started to break that the US colonial pipeline, a piece of infrastructure that supplies the nation's east coast with roughly half its fuel supply, was the target of a ransomware attack The pipeline, which is owned by Coke Industries, was forced to shut down for five days after a hacker gang by the name of DarkSide demanded a large sum for the decryption tools to continue to operate Gas prices spiked almost immediately after the news broke, and shortages across 16 states led to both the suspension of sale for many distributors, and for old captain America to put a $3 per gallon cap on the price of fuel That's roughly two and a half diddly wanks per huffle bog for typical commonwealth enjoyers watching Americans fearing a long and drawn out shortage, channeled their freedom instincts, with many hoarding fuel, in anything from containers, to fucking plastic bags However, what they didn't know, is that the CEO of the colonial pipeline, paid their ransom only hours after it was demanded, which amounted to a grand total of 70 bitcoin On the day of the transaction that equates to 4 million dollars, however, due to the magic of bitcoin, that same payment would be worth 2.6 million only two weeks later United States intelligence agencies don't believe that the attack was associated with any government or political entity, however, they nevertheless discouraged the ransom being paid, as it could incentivize future attacks With this being said, most companies this large will have insurance to cover these types of attacks, and having even a day of downtime for such a large operation, is usually infinitely more expensive than the few million dollars demanded by hackers No severe or long term damage was inflicted by the hack The nation of Colombia has been experiencing weeks long protests since the end of April, and because this series could basically be called, what made people angry this month, we decided to investigate At the end of April, people took to the streets to show their dissatisfaction for a new tax proposal, which would see over a hundred very boring changes written into Colombian law, that we promise we're not going to explain The point to understand is that Colombia is an extremely unequal nation, so much so, that it would take an estimated 11 generations of social climbing for a poor Colombian to reach even the mean income within the country A lot of people aren't just poor, they see poverty as an aspiration that may one day be achieved In a nation already crippled by COVID 19, the already struggling citizens of Colombia don't really care about high level shit, like trying to improve the country's international credit rating Things got even more heated, when in an interview, the minister of finance placed the cost of a carton of eggs to be 8 times lower than what they were in reality, cementing the reputation of Colombia's leadership as being severely out of touch with its working class population On the 25th of April, the situation worsened even more, when a video surfaced of a police helicopter shooting at protesters in the small city of Buga Only 3 days later, a police officer would later be filmed shooting a kid in the back, in retaliation for kicking his motorcycle Over the next few weeks, demonstrations across Colombia would become more intensified, with some assemblers picking up as many as 15,000 people However, over this same time, the police force put in place to keep order within these regions, would seemingly play a game of bingo, with a fun list of war crimes and human rights violations Which as of time of writing, would lead to the deaths of 41 civilians and 1 police officer A significant contributor to this clusterfuck of a situation has been Colombia's long running war with various rebel groups, paramilitary forces, or good old fashioned drug cartels In 2016, the Colombian government struck a peace agreement with one of the most significant groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FUC for short The rebels would agree to lay down their arms and disband, and in return, the government, among other things, would bring economic opportunity to remote areas that had suffered under a long and tedious war With this being said, after the current president, Ivan Duque Marquez, was elected two years later, both he and his party believed that the deal went too easy on the rebels And he's often been criticized for not doing enough to help these rural areas and cement a lasting peace This sentiment was echoed on 19 May, when Reuters reported the killing of former popular fuck leader, Jesus Antroch, in Venezuela Whether or not it was justified, will be down to the individual, but the move certainly didn't solidify the president as a keeper of peace In their own words, the protesters want dignified housing, the rebuilding of public spaces, and the maintaining of social programs which have greatly benefited the poor masses in Colombia In a country which has seen the poverty rate rise 400% in recent years, it's not such an unreasonable request, even when riot police seem to love role playing the no Russian mission from modern warfare 2 This series often has a habit of only showing negative or concerning news stories, and fails to cover events which might invoke other feelings from the wide spectrum of human emotions With this in mind, as a fun change of pace, this next story is downright heartbreaking The footage on screen, is the crew of the Nangla, an Indonesian submarine, singing the song Sampeh Jumper, in early April Later that month, on 21 April, this vessel, with all 53 crew, would be reported missing, and three days later, the submarine would be declared sunk, with no survivors In the time of writing, it's not certain what caused Nangla to fail, as it was later found in three pieces on the ocean floor, 800 meters below the surface Its disappearance occurred roughly 95 kilometers off the coast of Bali, as it was conducting a torpedo drill However, only one hour after receiving permission to dive, the vessel lost contact with surface personnel This attack has been all but ruled out, as an explosion would have been picked up by radar, and experts suspect that the submarine's fate was caused by a freak underwater wave, inadequate maintenance, or some kind of power failure It's difficult to properly convey just how dangerous the situation was for the Nangla If the power failed, the vessel would have had a three days supply of oxygen, to either restore functionality, or somehow be rescued The problem however, is that submarines are some of the stealthiest engineering marvels to have ever been invented, and there have been numerous cases of friendly subs running into each other, because of how fucking impossible they are to detect If the power did indeed fail, the sub may have simply started to sink deeper into the Bali sea, until it fell below the 500 meter crushing depth, which would have compromised the integrity of the hull Every sailor aboard a 41 year old vessel would receive the Navy Meritorious Service Star, and would all posthumously be promoted one rank higher out of respect for their lives Perhaps the most tragic part of all, was that the song recorded only weeks before the accident, Sampeh Jumper, roughly translates to Till We Meet Again, or simply, Goodbye We now come to the Myanmar coup, a military takeover by Funny Hat Man, that took place on the 1st of February, behind this woman's wonderful choreography Since then, hundreds of civilians have lost their lives in resistance movements, thousands have been arrested, and Brandon the writer has taken up drinking The winner of the country's election, and Sun Tzu Chi, has now been detained for over 120 days, with absolutely no way of knowing when, and if, the military government is going to pretend to give her a fair trial She's currently charged with bribery, abuse of power, and my personal favorite, being in possession of walkie talkies without a permit Personally, I like my elected officials to generally be law abiding citizens, but if I had to choose between someone who allegedly didn't hold a permit for what is essentially a phone, without access to Farmville, and a guy who's forcefully taken over a country and killed over 700 people, I'm likely to overlook documentation related discrepancies As if to reinforce my own rational beliefs, Funny Hat Man ordered a siege on the mountain town of Mindat this month, which would culminate in a series of airstrikes which would scar the landscape Facebook would maintain their reputation as the bastion of truth, as they've continuously censored anti-government and resistance news within the country However, it hasn't been the first time the company has been involved in Myanmar's internal affairs, as a source within the country kindly pointed out that during a 2017 crackdown on Rohingya Muslims, Facebook allowed the circulation of a fabricated story, which was claiming that these ethnic groups were sexually assaulting Burmese women This of course stirred hatred for an already unwelcome group within Myanmar, which led to the deaths of over 25,000 people, and the creation of over 700,000 Rohingya refugees Facebook does a lot of fucked up shit, but spreading bullshit for a military, actively committing a genocide, is pretty fucking cringe Another fun incident was the detention of a Japanese journalist, who was arrested after reporting on the conditions of inmates detained in Myanmar's In Sin prison, a place which houses protesters, media personnel, or whoever the military doesn't particularly like After a few days, the Japanese journalist was eventually let free, but they reported cases of unsanitary conditions, open wounds, and no health care available for prisoners One event that was near fucking impossible to report on, was the fire at the Yangon markets in the city of Shweebo The fire, which took place on the 15th of May, burned for roughly 5 hours in the early hours of the morning, and is suspected by one of our sources to have been started by members of the military According to our guy on the ground, the fire was started in retaliation for the treatment of both police and military personnel, who are often refused food by the local farmers There were claims that the food was stolen before the market was burnt to the ground, as supposedly evidence of food stuff was not found in the wreckage The entire incident isn't well documented, so viewers should take this portion with a grain of salt A study released by the United Nations this month predicts that by 2022, half the population of Myanmar will live in poverty, and while Thailand has committed to accept and house 80,000 refugees, it's hard to see the nation returning to normalcy anytime soon It's believed that the military coup and COVID-19 outbreak in tandem has set the country back a whole 16 years A report released by a New York-based research firm focused on national security threats has found that nearly a fifth of all QAnon Facebook posts between January and February this year originated from outside of the United States As we've never covered the QAnon movement on this series before, viewers should get comfortable because this shit is as funny as it is dangerous QAnon is an American conspiracy theory alleging that the US government is secretly run by Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles who run a global child sex trafficking ring The conspiracy started from a 2017 post on the image board website 4chan The anonymous user called Q, now thought to be multiple people, claimed to be a high-ranking member of the US government with access to classified information Q then started to offer supposed information drops and was able to build up a sizable following over multiple platforms for a tidy profit The QAnon belief was that former President Donald Trump had been planning a day of reckoning known simply as the storm which would see thousands of prominent Hollywood actors, politicians, and high-ranking officials arrested If this is starting to sound like a cult, that's because it absolutely fucking is, and as of July 2019, an FBI report listed the movement as a potential source of domestic terrorism QAnon-related incidents would slowly become more common within America, including the murder of a crime family underboss, the kidnapping of a child, and an assassination attempt on now-current President Joe Biden Stranger actions include the spreading of the conspiracy that the September 2020 wildfires on the west side of the US were caused by communist actors funded by billionaire George Soros in order to steal from evacuated properties The most notable event in the movement's long and colorful history was of course its participation of the storming of the US Capitol which saw an impressive turn out of QAnon supporters, including Ashley Babbitt, the woman who was shot by security personnel, and Jake Njeli, the guy who looks like a unit from Age of Empires Obviously the people who believe this shit are unfortunately misguided individuals, but you'd be surprised how many people subscribed to this belief A new poll of over 9000 US adults from a data analytics firm found that somewhere between 20 and 23% self-identified as either supporters, members, or believers of the QAnon movement Even a member of the US House of Representatives, Marjorie Taylor Greene, had previously been a supporter of the conspiracy With this in mind, Greene also believed that a 2018 California wildfire was caused by a Jewish-funded space laser to clear room for a high-speed rail project So it's safe to assume that she'd probably believe anything on the internet. In the off-chance that she happens to be watching, I'd like to direct her attention to our Patreon, where we're funding a movement to stop Italian vampires from taking over the FBI Hashtag see past the pastor. Circling back to our original headline, the revelation that the QAnon movement has been influenced by overseas administrators, rather than just a self-destructive group of US citizens, is certainly cause for concern The report acknowledged that due to the anonymous nature of many QAnon posters, identifying foreign actors isn't an exact science, however, by conducting linguistic analysis, researchers were able to identify actors in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Russia Although it was noted that Russian influencers were the source of most of the offshore material posted throughout 2020, the start of the year has seen the space dominated by Chinese-based accounts While the researchers were unable to say whether these actions were state-sanctioned by foreign governments, they were able to confirm that these administrations were at the very least aware of these actions Senior researcher and former State Department official, Jason Blaser-Kiss, had this to say Do I think the Russian and Chinese governments have awareness of this? I think the answer is absolutely yes. In China, nothing is going to be done without the Chinese government being aware of it I think there is at a minimum tacit support for the amplification we are seeing Luckily, both rational human beings and state-backed online agitators will love today's sponsor If you're trying to remain invisible online or just trying to watch region-locked content, then you'll probably want a VPN Surfshark VPN makes protecting your online privacy and watching prohibited Netflix shows as simple as the people who think 5G causes COVID-19 And you can rest easy knowing that your privacy will now be protected by sharks who have a bachelor's degree in computer sciences Gone are the days of attempting to watch a copy of The Simpsons movie, which was filmed in a cinema with a second-hand Nokia 3310 Simply change your location to anywhere you like and appreciate a whole cornucopia of new media to enjoy Signing up with the code on screen will give viewers an 83% discount, 3 months for free, and viewers who aren't 100% satisfied can back out in the first 30 days and get a full refund Surfshark VPN. It's cheaper than the other ones The month of May saw the death of the president of Chad, a 30-year head of state whose rule came to an end at the barrel of a gun President Mohamed Edris Davi was killed while visiting troops in the front line of the nation's conflict who were fighting a rebel group who have been competing for power since their formation in 2016 The now deceased president came to power in an armed uprising in 1990 and enjoyed one of the longest reigns in the entire region In fact, shortly before the president's untimely demise, he had just won his sixth term in office, a feat he only managed to accomplish by rewriting the constitution to suit his needs This is where things start to get fishy. The president was shot only a single day into his sixth term, which has led a few of our sources to believe that he may have been killed by his own son, 37-year-old Mohamed Edris Davi, the supreme commander of the armed forces Of course, there's an obvious narrative here of a son, now in his prime, ready to take over the mantle, only to be pushed aside by his father refusing to step down after 30 years, leading him to kill his own father in order to take power With this being said, although experts haven't ruled out that his death could have been orchestrated, we couldn't find anything beyond pure speculation to back up this claim Mohamed nevertheless took power immediately after the death of his father, taking over the country for the next 18 months, plenty of time to rig the next elections in his favor Opposition parties within the country, who were presumably only there to sell the illusion of a democracy, criticized the 18 month appointment, claiming that the move was nothing more than an institutional coup No fucking shit. Even the fucking rebels chimed in on the situation, reminding Mr. Mohamed that Chad is not a monarchy The international reaction to the takeover has been more positive than you might think, as despite Chad being the fifth least democratic country on earth Good old president Mohamed helped western powers murder a lot of islamist militants over his 30 year reign French president Emmanuel Macron was even seated at his funeral ceremony, presumably to gain favor with his son After all, it's much easier to provide their support for a foreign army in the fight against terrorism than to convince voters that you need boots on the ground Other countries weighed in on the transition of power, however, most seemed to be cool with Chad doing this banana republic shit if it means a more stable region with a reliable ally in the fight against terror This being said, viewers should make no mistake, Chad is no more free than it was last month, more like, under new management Meanwhile, a man who was wrongfully imprisoned for a year is charged $4,000 for his time in jail, a man from New Zealand is facing legal action, for drawing penises around potholes, and a city in Switzerland solves homelessness by giving beggars free tickets to other cities The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly every part of our lives, but one aspect that was initially unknown was how it would affect birth rates Many experts theorized that having people forced to work from home and being close proximity to each other would see a general increase in baby making capacity As someone from a small country community, we'd often joke that the reason teenage pregnancy was so high was because there was nothing else to do However, as it turns out, the pandemic has seen an overall decline in birth rates, particularly within the United States, with a 7% decrease in the first 9 months of lockdowns alone With this in mind, birth rates have been declining within the United States long before the pandemic knocked on the White House doors In many ways, this decrease has been a result of generally positive trends, such as better access to education, employment opportunities, a shift away from religious to more secular values, a higher level of women's autonomy, and better sex education However, one of the biggest reasons for this decline has simply been a question of finances Millennials, who are roughly between the ages of 25-40, are still recovering from the last recession in 2008, with stagnating wages, student loan debt, and higher costs for housing and child care Which is in turn leading many women to postpone having children until later in life, and generally having less offspring overall The recent coronavirus trends have however brought the United States more in line with other high-income countries, and it's been well documented that as nations become wealthier, people tend to have less children With this in mind, there may be consequences for this decline, as the pandemic has placed birth rates lower than death rates, sparking concerns that may create a demographic time bomb If there aren't enough younger workers to replace those retiring, the economy could slow down, and taxes would likely need to be raised to pay for pensions and social security funds Nations such as Italy and Japan have been experiencing similar problems, with the Italian government releasing an ad campaign, widely considered to be a tone-deaf attempt in the wake of rising daycare costs Japan has been funding AI matchmaking technology to help people find each other, with most matchmaking apps being incentivized to prolong the process to increase user attention It will be interesting to see whether Japanese efficiency will be able to make a dent in its aging population For the time being, the effects of a reduced birth rate won't be felt for another 20-30 years, but in a world where we plan around a 4-year election cycle and ignore a climate catastrophe for the past 50 years, we currently have the luxury to ignore these problems until someone important starts losing money Despite being the most impending existential threat humanity has ever faced, climate change has often had a problem with marketing. After all, who wants to listen to tree-hugging hippies or stupid lab coat-wearing science bitches? With this in mind, a new approach this month might just work In a memo released in the middle of May, the US army announced that it now classifies climate change as a serious threat to US national security interests and defense objectives The US secretary of defense was able to expand upon this decision, listing a number of reasons for this classification Firstly, the worsening effects of climate change will cause more intense and frequent weather events in Africa and Central America, threatening millions with drought, hunger, and displacement Not only would this stretch the world's ability to provide humanitarian aid, but people left without a place to call home tend to be ripe for radicalization Secondly, the defense department has been directly impacted by climate change-related extreme weather events in the past, such as Hurricane Michael, inflicting billions worth of damage at a Florida airbase California wildfires forcing the evacuation of military installations, and a 2019 typhoon, forcing the cessation of training exercises with the Australian and Japanese military The third reason is entirely down to combat logistics. Energy is the lifeblood of any modern military, and a dependence on fossil fuels that are both finite and produced by nations that may not always align with US interests could be a recipe for failure The US military has made it clear that transitioning their vehicle fleet to electric alternatives, deploying green energy generation and storage infrastructure, and investing in more efficient green technology is a national security priority In terms of the overall effects this could have on greenhouse gas emissions, it could be much larger than you might think By some estimates, the US military is a bigger emitter than the entire nation of Peru, which if it were a country, would place it 47th highest in the world Freedomland's European allies have also expressed their intent to transition their militaries to greener and more logistically agile alternatives, meaning this may be a significant leap to a more sustainable future Who could have guessed that one of the biggest steps to tackle climate change would be the byproduct of being able to kill people more efficiently Likely the biggest headline hog of this month was the ongoing friction between Israel and Palestine, the most stubborn conflict in the world. We at the SWAG news team were rightfully scared shitless to cover this topic, as although we've written about controversial and convoluted topics before, this one in particular hasn't been one we've previously been willing to tackle In the process of researching the situation was long and tedious, and even for Brandon the writer, who has 20 years of professional writing experience, he claims this was still one of the hardest stories he'd written to date Somewhere along the line, we decided that trying to cram something this big into a regular news video would be skipping over a lot of details and nuances, which is why we're only going to be touching on it briefly today before we cover it in more depth at some point next month We'll be maintaining an unbiased approach to our coverage. The whole situation more or less started at the end of the first world war, when the region which was previously controlled by the Ottoman empire was given to the winning powers of Britain and France to do with whatever the fuck they wanted Previously, the Jewish and Arab populations within the region coexisted mostly in peace, until they didn't. The Arab population were forming a distinctly Palestinian identity, while at the same time, the Jewish population, who were historically stateless, figured the shifting borders would give them a place to call home The nation of British Palestine was subsequently born, however, following a mass migration of Jews into the area, tensions between the Arab and Jewish population would become more common In 1947, the British empire would decide to peace the fuck out, and the united nations would split the region into Jewish Israel and Arab Palestine, and the UN would go home at night, knowing that war was no more. Until the very next year As it turns out, the surrounding Arab states simply saw the nation of Israel as colonialism with extra steps, and would declare war in an attempt to restore the old Arab dominated Palestine This would end in the Arab states getting clapped by the following year, which resulted in Israel pushing past the pre-established borders, the exact opposite of what these Arab states wanted In 1967, another conflict called the Six Day War, would see Israel win another successful victory over Jordan, Syria, and Egypt, meaning not only would the Jewish state now control all of Palestine, but it would extend its borders even further into the territory of its neighbors Over the next few decades, Israel would eventually return its huge Egyptian gains, and even make informal peace with a few of its neighbors, however, it would still treat its internal land as entirely that of Israel It would then begin the legally shaky process of settling within areas that the UN treaty would consider part of Palestine The reason we consider this a gray area is that depending on which country you ask, you'd likely going to get a very different answer on who controls the region Here's a fun map to make things more confusing Fast forward to today, and Palestine has regained a small amount of power to govern themselves, while the violent Palestinian militant group, Hamas, has broken away from the Palestinian authority altogether, and now controls the blockaded region of Gaza Unlike the rest of Palestine, who have generally sought diplomacy, Hamas has stated that its primary goal is to destroy the state of Israel After 600 words of backstory, let's now get into what happened this month On the 7th of May, the Associated Press reported that Palestinian worshippers clashed with Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, a major holy site for both Islam and Judaism The press cited that this clash would lead to 136 people wounded, and 83 hospitalized, resulting in a once again unstable region, which would descend into 11 days of uninterrupted fighting One of the reasons why this story was so fucking hard to cover, was how much bullshit was circulated online over the conflict In one instance, an official Israeli source claimed in this video that Palestinians were being hit by an accurate rocket fire launched by Hamas However, this was found to be a video taken from 2018, with the munitions being fired by the Syrian government in an entirely separate conflict In another video, Twitter users claimed that Hamas had set up this rocket launcher in a crowded residential area However, this again was found to be fabricated, as it was actually a 2018 clip of an Israeli truck, which took a wrong turn in northern Israel This one was particularly strange, because although there's plenty of evidence of Hamas actually doing this, social media sites still picked up on the wrong footage There are several more instances of similar misleading social media claims, however in the interest of time, we're going to move on By the 11th of May, widespread civil unrest took hold throughout Israel, especially in mixed cities This is what a local Israeli had to say about these instances One day you have a group of Israelis, they see an Arab and they try to lynch him, and another day, you have a group of Arabs, and they see an Israeli, they will try to lynch him It is a terrible cycle. It is the worst cycle in the world By the 11th of May, Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was pressured by local authorities to deploy border police in an attempt to quell the violence Claiming that the entire region was on the brink of civil war The very next day on the 12th, over 950 rockets were exchanged between Israel and Hamas, which even for the Americans on our team, is still a decent amount of firepower By the 14th, Israel had blown up a not so secret tunnel being dug by Hamas, and by the 15th, an Israeli rocket strike would hit an office building in Gaza, which had supposedly housed Hamas militants As it turns out, the building housed the local offices of both the news organizations the Associated Press and Al Jazeera, the latter of which is owned by the Qatar government, a state not on the best of terms with Israel anyway Benjamin Netanyahu saw this as an absolute win By the 17th of May, the leaders of both France and Egypt offered to help mediate the situation While US President Joe Biden responded to questions related to the region by showing viewers how fast he could drive in Ford's new electric pickup truck Journalists reportedly heard him mutter something about Area 51 technology being way cooler as he drove off into the sunset After 11 days of fighting, both Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire, but not before 243 people had died in the fighting Both sides declared victory With another month of news finally concluded, it's time to continue our tradition of posting fuck all content all month While bombarding viewers with videos right at the end that YouTube conveniently forgets to recommend Viewers who are so inclined can visit my discord server to get bullied, the swag subreddit to FarmEZKarma Or the twitter profiles of both myself and the rest of the team to know what we are doing between releases The team pours hundreds of hours a month into making videos like this one Which is why we've also got a Patreon link in the description for those who want to support what we do and fund our inevitable mental decline As always, our list of sources is in the description We'd like to thank all supporters, people who we were able to interview, and every single viewer for making this series possible On behalf of everyone on the team, we'd like to wish you all a happy month of June
